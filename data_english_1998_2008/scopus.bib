abstract={In most design activities, the design decision-making process is not recorded explicitly, which has severe impacts on design modification and design reuse. This paper presents a design thinking process model that records not only the design procedure and decisions but also the design intents behind them. The design thinking process is evolved based on the interaction among design intents, solutions and operations. Three types of inconsistency situation are analyzed and the design decision support prototype system is presented for capturing and managing the design thinking process. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Support vector machine (SVM) is trained to classify the mobile nodes as cluster-head nodes or member nodes in this paper. The improved method of SVM is presented. Based on SVM, The process of the classification and clustering is designed .The trained SVM was used to recognize the mobile nodes in MANet. It properly chooses the function subsets and the discrimination function to make the learning machine least risk. The SVM classifier is made to learn the result of the WCA clustering algorithm so as to cluster mobile Ad-hoc network as the WCA. Simulation results show that compared to other methods, the method presented is more easily to simplify the clustering process in MANet. And the request of real-time clustering of nodes in mobile network can be satisfied. The end is new design thinking and the conclusion for the research. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Prototyping is the pivotal activity that structures innovation, collaboration, and creativity in design. Prototypes embody design hypotheses and enable designers to test them. Framing design as a thinking-by-doing activity foregrounds iteration as a central concern. This paper presents d.tools, a toolkit that embodies an iterative-design-centered approach to prototyping information appliances. This work offers contributions in three areas. First, d.tools introduces a statechart-based visual design tool that provides a low threshold for early-stage prototyping, extensible through code for higher-fidelity prototypes. Second, our research introduces three important types of hardware extensibility - at the hardware-to-PC interface, the intra-hardware communication level, and the circuit level. Third, d.tools integrates design, test, and analysis of information appliances. We have evaluated d.tools through three studies: a laboratory study with thirteen participants; rebuilding prototypes of existing and emerging devices; and by observing seven student teams who built prototypes with d.tools.

abstract={Creative thinking requires imagination, creativity, play, sharing and reflection. This paper presents an architecture for a curious, reconfigurable robot that encourages creative design thinking by permitting designed structures to learn behaviours. These behaviours encourage designers to play with different structures, reflect on the relationship between structure and behaviour and imagine new structures. A demonstration of the architecture is described using the Lego Mindstorms platform. The demonstration shows how a curious robot can adapt new behaviours in response to changes in its structure, and how this can encourage the creative thinking spiral and creative design. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={How can we prepare engineering students to work collectively on innovative design issues, i.e. ones that are usually considered as ill-defined, "wicked" problems? Engineering science teaching has to be completed by some experience of design. Project-Based Learning (PBL) has long been seen as a good way to learn design although it is also recognised that it has to be backed by knowledge on design thinking, to help focus on the critical learning issues. Historical cases in creative engineering and industrial design teaching show cases of "project-based critical learning" (PBCL) where PBL was in fact supported by clear design thinking with three common principles: acquiring strong (disciplinary) knowledge, learning to be ready to produce knowledge, learning to design in unknown situations. C-K theory, a recent theory of design reasoning which accounts for creative design, models the design process using existing knowledge, expanding knowledge bases and exploring unknown concepts. Hence it provides relevant knowledge on design thinking to support teaching of innovative design. We illustrate the use of C-K theory, first in an interpretative way, to reveal active knowledge expansion in creative projects; and second as a methodological tool to support the design of smart shopping carts.},

abstract={This paper introduces a taxonomy of physical prototypes, benchmarking it with existing classifications to elucidate the advantages and disadvantages. The proffered taxonomy is evaluated by three approaches: (i) checking the orthogonality of the individual elements of the taxonomy, (ii) benchmarking the proposed taxonomy with existing classifications of prototypes, and (iii) demonstrating its utility by applying it to classify different prototypes. The results show the proposed taxonomy is capable of distinguishing prototypes with greater precision than what is possible with current classifications. Further, the proposed classification is generally orthogonal, allowing for more consistent delineation between prototypes. However, the findings also reveal that some of the taxa are interdependent; exploring these interdependencies to develop a deeper understanding of how prototyping influences design thinking is the focus of future research.

The results show that: (1) Cognitive progress can be observed from the design thinking and drawing patterns that emerge in designing works. The thinking activity was distinguished into general, experiential and evaluating thoughts, whereas drawing activity was categorized into graphic drawing and word description. (2) On the whole, more time was spent on general thought, less on experiential thought, and the least on evaluating thought. (3) There were three stages of concept development. General thought occurs more frequent in the initial stage while picture sketch takes place more frequent in the middle and final stages. In the other words, the process of the concept development was filled up via the concepts formed at first stage and translated into idea sketches at the next two stages.},

abstract={This paper was first presented at Plea2004 - The 21st Conference on Passive and Low Energy Architecture in Eindhoven, The Netherlands, 19 22 September 2004. It is reprinted here as a sequel to illustrate one of the key points about socio-climatic design knowledge for the heuristic and pre-parametric thinking process of architects discussed in the previous chapter by Bay. This paper reports on a framework for developing a particular set of guidelines with interdisciplinary knowledge, namely, architecture design, social behaviour and climatic condition. The Guidelines are created to guide socio-climatic design of semi-open spaces of high-rise apartments. The concept of socio-climatic design, which is proposed by Bay (2004, 2003, 2002), brings together two major concerns: social-cultural and climatic-ecological issues. Building simulation is discussed as a parametric tool to assist pre-parametric design thinking, which is a common heuristic used by designers in practice. The research methodology includes three steps: case study, building simulation and pattern design. A sample of the guidelines based on two high-rise dwellings in Singapore is illustrated in a visual chart, which will show the correlations of sizes, expected social performance, and predicted bio-climatic behaviours, for clear communication.},

abstract={The Norwegian Council of Education has decided to implement a new course in the two last years of the secondary school in Norway. The course is called "Technology and Science", TAS, and has as main object to give the pupils an understanding of the roles of a designer, an engineer and a scientist, and show how their work is related to development of products, processes and society. The course had a description, but no specific content or learning materials when it started first time autumn 2007. The course description is very fragmented, and it gives no real support of how to teach and what to teach. Is it possible to use the design process and the design thinking as the leading tread to make TAS become an interesting, challenging course? We looked at this course as a great opportunity to give our future coming students good knowledge of their future roles as designers, engineers or scientists. This was the motivation for developing a tailored model for TAS which communicates the design process in a simple way and shows how it can be used for any kind of project. This paper describes the background for the introduction of TAS and the motivation for developing a pedagogical tool based on design thinking and project based learning. The discussion and evaluation is based on results from a case study and response from teachers of the course.},

abstract={The improved control algorithm in central air conditioning control system is discussed in this paper. Based on a number of practical projects, a primary theory model of expert fuzzy logic controller is established. The expert control ideal is applied in the framework design process of the air conditioning control system. The boundaries of membership function are decided by expert experience, and the flexible control rule set is designed. The realization of the core algorithm depends on parameters adjustable Fuzzy-PD algorithm to ensure the control precision and the flexibility. The detailed design steps and key design result are given. The MATLAB simulation result proves the design is reasonable and can be applied in practical projects. The design thinking in this paper is new and can help engineers improve their control strategy in their practical works. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Reusing existing successful design can reduce time and cost of product development. Unfortunately the traditional design process templates reveal less details about the designer's thinking process to other designers. This paper explores a method of delivering sufficient knowledge to make design process reuse worthwhile by attaching cognitive knowledge such as design intents and justifications to the generic knowledge template. Not only the design procedures but also rationales behind them are included in this template. Standards for the retrieval of the template contents, rules for representation of the template ingredients, formal guidelines for reuse of these templates and procedures for their composition into more complex design process are discussed. The cognitive template is extracted from design thinking process models developed in the authors' previous research. There are three steps for design process reuse based on this template: 1)searching matched or partly matched templates from template base; 2) customizing or composing multiple templates into one more complex template to satisfy the design requirements; 3) instantiating this template referring to design conditions. A design process navigation system is developed for reusing design process based on this cognitive template. An instance of design process reuse is illuminated to validate this system.

abstract={The rapid movement from Computer-Aided Drafting (CAD) to Building Information Modeling (BIM) by professional architects and engineers creates several challenges and opportunities for Architecture and Architectural Engineering programs. The BIM methodology offers dramatic new benefits to students that university programs have just begun to explore, but it also will likely trigger trade-off considerations for traditional skills that might be lost. Some educators worry that new BIM activities pose a threat to design thinking. This paper surveys some of the major challenges and opportunities that BIM presents in educational settings, with several suggestions for future directions for exploration. These findings are discussed in the context of several key conclusions that have been developed based on six semesters using BIM in junior - and senior - level architectural design studios in an undergraduate program in Architectural Engineering. The paper remarks on accreditation issues, and it seeks to develop potential 'best practice' hallmarks with the goal of stimulating future discussion. © 2008 ASCE.},

abstract={Over the last decade significant research has been carried out in developing and refining new types of surgical instrument. More traditional instruments such as scalpels, forceps and the like have however changed little over the years, with the design of this equipment often predating contemporary ergonomic and design thinking. Recently however a number of safety concerns have forced a rethink on how fundamental surgical equipment is designed. In the case of surgical scalpels disposability and sharps safety have come to the fore. This paper summarises investigations into how safety related design changes have been interpreted by a number of manufacturers. Physical analysis, computer modeling and practical human factors trials were performed to determine whether these design changes have opened an opportunity to rethink the design of traditional instruments or whether the incorporation of safety features compromise ergonomic efficiency. Results indicate that the safety changes can have both positive and negative impact on the ergonomics of the devices. More significantly the external pressures from safety related policies could act as a catalyst to force reevaluation of the conservative view of traditional surgical products.},

In Norway, eight out of 10 new jobs are created within service industries and three out of four employees work in service provision. Services are not the same as products, yet we often find companies designing services using product-based methods with the result that the design of the user experience is not given the focus it deserves. This paper describes a method, AT-ONE, which is being developed to assist in the early stages of the service innovation process. Its focus is to design innovative and engaging service experiences, and at the same time, encourage design thinking in the organisation. The paper describes the background for the method, the method itself and first results from its use within several service providers.},

abstract={In this age of globalization and environmental crises, the ethical consciousness is heightened and the desire to design appropriately for a place, its climate and people, with appropriate technology is increasing. Architects rely on precedent knowledge to design their next building, believing the past buildings worked well and the knowledge can be transferred to their new design, promising similar performances. Cognitive biases (illusions) and potential errors can occur when using precedent knowledge for analogical, pre-parametric and qualitative design thinking. This essay refers largely to part of a completed research (Bay 2001b, 2002, 2003) on how heuristic biases, discussed by Tversky and Kahneman (1982) in cognitive psychology, can affect judgement and learning of facts from precedents in architectural design, made explicit using a kernel of conceptual system (Tzonis et. al., 1978) and a framework of architectural representation (Tzonis 1992). These are used here to consider how such illusions and errors in the human mind may be transferred to knowledge in publications and computeraided design thinking, and how they may be reduced with certain knowledge structures and mechanisms for more accurate thinking. The case of tropical architecture design is used to discuss these issues.},

abstract={This article provides an overview of computer software and instructional strategies intended to engage young people in making computer games, to achieve a variety of educational goals. It briefly describes the most popular of such programs and compares their key features, including the kinds of games that can be created with the software, the types of communities and resources that are associated with each program, claims made for learning outcomes resulting from use of the software, and the results of empirical research (if any) on the application and outcomes of the software in formal or informal educational settings. A key finding is that existing software and educational applications stress the goal of teaching users about computer programming and place little or no emphasis on teaching concepts related to game design. It concludes by discussing the potential value of explicit attention to "design thinking" as goal of game making in education. © 2008 Sage Publications.},

abstract={Complex Product (CoP) innovation is a process of knowledge fusion-oriented collaborative innovative design. In this paper, according to the feature of CoP development, an evolvable shared mental model (ESMM), which is composed of collaborative innovative design process model (DPM), design object model (DOM) based on knowledge ontology and design thinking model (DTM) based on design intention, is proposed. DPM describes the process of collaborative innovative design, DOM describes the explicit knowledge in the design process and DTM describes the tacit knowledge in the design process. Also, the co-evolution method of DOM and the collaborative modeling method of DTM are brought forward, which support explicit knowledge fusion and tacit knowledge fusion of collaborative innovative design separately. Finally, the architecture of CoP collaborative innovative design system based on the ESMM is proposed. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Internet's rapid growth promoted the evolutoin of network based applications. Since a particular network application has its special requirements for network topology, many different protocols have been introduced over the last couple of years. Most of these protocols overlap and are redundant in function, which results in bad overall performance of the application and the network. This paper presents an IPv6 QoS-based simple streaming transport protocol (SSTP), which enables the next generation networks to perform better and takes into account the feature of multimedia stream transmission. The protocol has been implemented and deployed in various multimedia based implementations. This paper will not only introduce the background and design thinking behind SSTP, but also describe the SSTP in detail. At last, the paper compares the performance of SSTP and RTP/RTCP, and gives the considerations about improvement of SSTP. ©2008 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper describes a study to understand the use of analogies by design engineers with different levels of experience. Protocol analyses of twelve design engineers have been analysed to understand the functions and reasoning of the analogies. The protocols are real world data from the aerospace industry. The findings indicate a significant difference in both the functions and reasoning by novices and experienced designers. Novices were found to predominantly transfer information without explicit reference to design issues, whereas experienced designers tended to either solve or identify problems. Experienced designers were found to reason about the function of a component and to some degree the predicted behaviour of the component, whereas the novices seem to lack such reasoning processes.

abstract={Thanks to the constant development of computer science, new CAD technology has been emerging in endless these years. In the process of modern design, it is quite indispensable for an excellent designer that learns the technology and creates better design with it. Besides, illogical thinking is an essential kind of thinking mode that sometime helps designers solve problems. This paper explains the necessity of using CAD technology and illogical thinking, and shows how they work together to achieve a better design. The destination of using CAD technology is to exhibit designers' concept completely, and therefore designers should keep their mind innovative when using CAD technology to develop their concept design. In this way, they can make much better design than ever. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Mind mapping is a technique which applies whole brain thinking to substitute one's traditional thinking mode. Through the path of framing the subject to diverge human thinking, and connecting the 2nd/3rd level to the lst/2nd level branches, mind mapping can achieve its target as a method of specifying radial thinking. Conceptual design is the summary of designers' organizing and refining their emotional and sudden thinking. Utilizing mind mapping appropriately in conceptual design could help us keeping the balance of sciences and arts, as well as of logical and imaginary thinking, so that designers' potential could be fully developed. The product of conceptual design is designers' ultimate pursuing, and the creativity in designing procedure is their high-way of thinking. Application of mind mapping could concentrate and enforce human intellectual in conceptual design. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={What is Design? The lack of consensus on a common definition for design and whether its body of knowledge constitutes a science or a discipline continue driving investigations of the nature of design. Despite the ambiguity, design is recognized as a process of creative problem solving and as such has become an integral part of modern business practices. The shift from product-focus towards user and experience focus has paved the way for interdisciplinary design research and the adoption of new investigative tools. Researchers agree that the understanding of the complexity of modern society requires holistic thinking, and therefore demands the implication of expert disciplines in the process of building design knowledge. How has the evolved mindset impacted design education? Although, interdisciplinary practices and transdisciplinary thinking have been acknowledged as a fundamental notion of building design knowledge, design programs seem to have made only timid adjustments in their curricula to address this new dimension. Traditional teaching methods and settings reveal themselves as insufficient and address little systemic thinking. Hence, alternative design approaches are being experimented with. The intent of this paper is to describe how the School of Industrial Design at the University of Montreal has reassessed its program to reflect the evolved mindset and what is being done to facilitate interdisciplinary design approaches.},

With the design cognition as the essential element of cultivation, restriction is the basic requirement for design and also the starting point of finding the breakthrough. Only after the students have formed independent and mature design cognition and the regular pattern of modeling through practicing can they gain a solid background for the product design for their further study. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Since the early 90s Loughborough University has included sustainability in its teaching, but in 2000 an education for sustainability programme was developed by Eddie Norman to further engage second year students with the sustainable design agenda. Sustainable design thinking is now integrated into other parts of degree level teaching within all years. Sustainable design also plays an important role in postgraduate studies within the department. The Department of Design and Technology has been involved in a number of research projects related to sustainable design which include the development of a number of tools, and the dissemination of new understanding for professional designers to get to grips with sustainability. Loughborough University has also been strongly involved with the development of sustainable design resources for schools. These initiatives are presented and the similarities and differences between these approaches are discussed. A view of the importance of developing an integrated approach to design for sustainability, that builds knowledge as a student's education continues, is presented along with reflections on how this approach better prepares future designers for industry.},

abstract={In this paper, we explore the use of collaborative exercises and mental map visualizations as tools for understanding social practices and exploring co-design opportunities for product and service development. The research is based on material gathered through a case study of a web-based data storage service in its beta stage. We use these tools to study the interconnections of the designed system to an array of other applications, tools and services, which form what we refer to as people's digital ecosystem. Our experiences suggest that taking practices as the unit of analysis is a relevant strategy to bring forward users' own knowledge of their everyday life, and link it to the professional knowledge of developers and designers; and that visualizations and collaborative exercises are relevant design thinking strategies.

abstract={Recently, attempts to computerize and automate the engineering design process have taken the front stage. Indeed, theory and applications suggesting novel methods in utilizing computers to aid in the design process have been suggested. These suggestions range from number-crunching and storage techniques to ones that claim artificial intelligence whereby a computer can suggest new designs based on a pre-defined set of specifications. This paper focuses on the conceptual (synthesis) stage of the design process, i.e. establishing the requirements, the product concept and finally the solution concept. These steps complete the conceptual design of a given product and this paper examines the potential of these steps to be developed as a computer-based system, without hindering the creative process. It was observed that whilst humans can think with four different thinking styles, computers predominantly process information in two. The remaining two thinking styles that computers lack account for creativity and innovation in humans. Also identified in this paper was the fact that all four thinking quadrants in the human brain need to be utilized in order to produce an innovative design. This led to the conclusion that with current computer technology, it is impossible for a computer program to generate innovation, even though much research has recently focused on artificial intelligence and genetic algorithms. A computer-based system was developed to capture, index and retrieve information in an organized and prioritized fashion as well as guide the designer through the systematic process. © 2008 CAD Solutions, LLC.},

abstract={There are only few periods in history in which architecture and urban planning acquired the speed of development they have today. This acceleration of development has to do with fundamental changes in our society. Cultural and economical changes in the framework of globalization and growing international dependencies, technological innovations like the establishment of new traffic and transportation systems, the introduction of automated production methods and robots in industry and the even broader application of information and communication technology in everyday life - all these developments are affecting the cities and city life - while environmental risks at a global scale are forcing us to consider the sustainability of our technologies, our life styles and our behavior. At the same time, in designing our environment we are confronted with an unprecedented abundance of forms and possibilities, enlarged even further by the possibilities offered by the computer. We are being forced to learn, sometimes with great difficulties, to control this abundance and to restore it to a (more or less) consistent language. The challenges of urban transformation no longer can be faced by analytical or regulative approaches (if they ever have been faced in that way). Conceptual thinking - design thinking - is necessary not only to make a plan, but even more to understand future opportunities and threatens. In this respect - maybe more than in the past - the process of design has become a process of exploration, a process of researching new spatial possibilities and investigating new methodological approaches. This process we could call research by design. In this article I will discuss the demands for research by design against the background of fundamental changes in the practice of designing the built environment. © 2008 IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={High power drives with multiphase machine utilizes paralleled legs converters to realize required power. In addition to the reduced rating of the used semiconductor devices, higher redundancy level could be achieved. Being a relatively new technology for the combination of VSI-fed operation and salient pole synchronous machines, a through analysis is needed. This paper investigates 6-phase synchronous machines with emphasis on redundancy, fault conditions, the machine's behavior under non-sinusoidal voltage profiles and sensitivity of the design parameters. It is shown that new design thinking is required when considering converter-induced machine losses, especially those on the rotor surface. Redundancy study shows the possibility of operating the machine at half load when one supply system is totally or partially lost without exceeding machine's total losses. When studying fault scenarios, the worst case is found to be 4-phase short circuit (equivalent to 2-phase in a 3-phase machine) for the studied cases. Output from sinus supply voltage study was utilized to understand losses distribution inside the machine and establish an effective comparison with different voltage profiles. A study with square wave and DTC supplies shows higher losses in damper bar, when compared to sinus supply. Voltage profiles of two different DTC schemes are studied which show that with particular well-thought control strategies one can improve the machine losses specially those in the damper bars. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose This paper aims to inform and improve the quality of electronic products and services by outlining an approach to ethically grounded design. Design/methodology/approach A number of design disciplines were investigated using desk research and also learning from experience in commercial design practice in the mobile phone, Internet and software industries. Findings It is suggested that design “scripts” specific behaviours with either good or bad results. Scripts have a behavioural element and they define the physical, social and individual impact of products and services. This suggests that designers should be aware of the impact design decisions have throughout the product lifecycle. In order to achieve this, three ethical design principles (situated research, reflexivity and participation) are proposed to frame ethical design practice. Research limitations/implications It is suggested that measuring impact alone is insufficient to minimise harm caused by electronic products and services. Instead, research should focus on positively informing design through actionable results in the participatory design tradition. Conversely, design needs to accommodate research into measuring the impact of products in order to deliver long-term benefits to users rather than perpetuating passive consumption. Practical implications The paper provides an overview of methods for value-centred interaction design based on the analysis of alternative approaches to ethical design. Originality/value The research in the paper spans a number of related but heretofore separate disciplines pertinent to deepening design thinking. These disciplines are critiqued on the basis of their appropriateness and applicability to an ethical design approach and the concept of scripting, used in traditional design, is applied to interactivity. Lastly, three new principles are proposed for ethically grounded design. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={Marching toward the 21st century, there are not only drastic changes in global economic and political development, but also in technological advancement and ecological evolution. All of these are intertwined with one another to shape national and societal development in various areas. In the milieu of education, these changes exert great influence on the way we perceive learning and instruction, this in turn calls for a paradigm shift in the way we design learning and instruction. Consequently, calls to critically examine the way we have been designing our learning and instruction have gained more and more attention in the past decade. Since design could help in realizing our visionary ideals, and transforming these ideals into innumerable learning and working contexts, we need to probe into how our learning and instruction could be more creatively and powerfully designed. The author contends that most learners, through the process of critical envision and enaction, could learn to design their own learning, either independently or collectively, through the cultivation of design capacities. In this paper, the author first presents the historical analysis of the theoretical foundations of instructional design, and then takes a critical approach to examining the alternative possibilities of instructional design. Based on the critical perspectives of design, she develops the critical design inquiry by integrating the richness of contemporary critical thinking into that of systems thinking and design thinking. To make the critical design inquiry an educational praxis, rather than just another design theory, the author takes a participatory and collaborative approach to design with a group of adult students. The critical design approach aims at enlightening the adult learners' inner systems revolution and enriching the outer learning environments through collaborative design engagement. In the final section, the author explicates how the confined roles of instructional designers could be conceptualized through the critical design inquiry. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={There is growing psychological research linking affect to the content and process of thinking. This paper deals with one aspect of affect and social cognition, the interaction of affect and shared understanding. It is theorized that affect may have cognitive processing consequences for shared understanding in design. In order to investigate this question, this paper develops a research method that brings together theories and instruments from cognitive science, linguistics, and design studies to study the link between affect and shared understanding in design. First, the paper reviews a framework for analyzing the process of creating shared understanding. Second, the paper presents a linguistic framework and analysis technique for extracting affective content from language based on the explicit, conscious expression of affect through favorable and unfavorable attitudes towards specific subjects. Third, the paper proposes a model of shared understanding that is interdependent, in part, with affective processing. The linguistic analysis and shared understanding analysis framework are applied to a transcript of collaborative design to illustrate how the affective content of designers' communication shifts design activities. We find that our research method allows affect to be observed concurrently with cognitive processing and that, owing to the motivational consequences of affect, produces an axis of evaluation that could shed light on how affect organizes and drives the outcomes of design thinking.

abstract={In the past, design has most often occurred fairly far downstream in the development process and has focused on making new products aesthetically attractive or enhancing brand perception through smart, evocative advertising. Today, as innovation's terrain expands to encompass human-centered processes and services as well as products, companies are asking designers to create ideas rather than to simply dress them up. Brown, the CEO and president of the innovation and design firm IDEO, is a leading proponent of design thinking -a method of meeting people's needs and desires in a technologically feasible and strategically viable way. In this article he offers several intriguing examples of the discipline at work. One involves a collaboration between frontline employees from health care provider Kaiser Permanente and Brown's firm to reengineer nursing-staff shift changes at four Kaiser hospitals. Close observation of actual shift changes, combined with brainstorming and rapid prototyping, produced new procedures and software that radically streamlined information exchange between shifts. The result was more time for nursing, better-informed patient care, and a happier nursing staff. Another involves the Japanese bicycle components manufacturer Shimano, which worked with IDEO to learn why 90% of American adults don't ride bikes. The interdisciplinary project team discovered that intimidating retail experiences, the complexity and cost of sophisticated bikes, and the danger of cycling on heavily trafficked roads had overshadowed people's happy memories of childhood biking. So the team created a brand concept- "Coasting" -to describe a whole new category of biking and developed new in-store retailing strategies, a public relations campaign to identify safe places to cycle, and a reference design to inspire designers at the companies that went on to manufacture Coasting bikes.},

Therefore, an experiment was performed to evaluate how a design innovation course could be transferred across cultures, disciplines and institutions. Specifically, a graduate level engineering design course from Stanford University was emulated at the University of St Gallen in Switzerland. The course methodology exemplifies the innovation approach taken by notable companies that represent the innovation success of Silicon Valley. The results obtained from a series of interviews indicate that there is a set of essentials to this pedagogy, which, when transferred, led to similar innovation success elsewhere. © 2008 TEMPUS Publications.},

abstract={Before integrated design thinking in teams can occur, team members must create an environment in which collaboration is possible - a 'relational space' determined by the identities individuals construct for and of one another. As design collaborations expand across cultural and disciplinary boundaries, identity construction becomes more crucial and more difficult, especially in virtual environments. As a result, engineering educators need to understand and teach appropriate transferable practices that students can bring to team environments, particularly those that involve crossing boundaries - be they disciplinary, cultural or geographic. A case study based on crosscultural, cross-disciplinary collaboration in a capstone design course shows that through instruction students become aware of the importance of collaborating across cultural and disciplinary boundaries, and through experience in actual projects they become aware of the complexities posed by such collaboration. Case study data, in conjunction with a substantial literature review, identify research questions to guide curricular development in engineering that combines instruction and hands-on experience to help students construct professional identities that support sharing design knowledge in cross-cultural, cross-disciplinary team environments. © 2008 TEMPUS Publications.},

abstract={In our increasingly flat and connected world, skills in innovation and creative design have emerged as key attributes for graduating engineering designers. Metaphors and analogies are commonly voiced as key tools for enhancing creative design yet little research has been performed on their relation to each other and their use within the design process. In this paper we discuss the relationship between metaphor and analogy use in the design process, with a focus on engineering education. We support our discussion with results from interviews and experiments with student designers. Our results highlight that both metaphor and analogy are spontaneously used by student designers and that metaphor dominates as the design tool for early problem-framing design phases whereas analogy dominates as a tool for concept generation. We also present an analysis of the metaphors for our understanding of design in use within Germany, the UK and Mexico. We found an 85 per cent overlap between textbook usages of metaphors in conceptual design in these countries as compared to textbooks authored in the United States, suggesting that cross-cultural differences in design understanding are relatively small in higher education. We close by presenting a design by analogy method to promote and enhance the use of analogy as a skill for graduating engineering designers. © 2008 TEMPUS Publications.},

abstract={"D.school" classes are educational units composed of interdisciplinary teams of students and supervisors. They include both the university and the industry and together they are introducing a new culture of "design thinking" following the example of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford. D.school is based on design thinking and it emphasises the importance of various sciences and their collaboration with the aim to solve complex problems. Four faculties and five companies worked together on the d.school project which is presented in this paper. Eight international groups of students from Ljubljana and foreign universities under the supervision of their professors prepared 20 drafts. Many prototypes were presented at the 18th International Ljubljana furniture fair and three were awarded.},

abstract={Design is the process in which designers use their expertise and experience to acquire design solutions. Most design results can only exhibit what the design is, but cannot reveal how and why an artifact is designed the way it is. Design intent is the motivations, rules and reasons behind design activities, and the capture, representation and transmission of design intent are of great significance to externalization of tacit knowledge. This paper addresses the representation of design intent for design thinking process modeling. The design thinking process model (DTPM) is composed of design intents, process knowledge and operations. The basic elements and categories of design intents are discussed in detail and eight types of design thinking process segments are expressed by the relationship of design intents and design operations. The examples of an original design process and a routine design process are taken to embody and validate the model.},

abstract={Design thinking (Owen, 2005), articulated around systems thinking, facilitates the definition of complex issues in a sustainable way, in which all actors and stakeholders (AS) play a predominant role. Innovative procedures, such as ‘management by design’, highlight the role of AS in structuring the project from and through the design process. Consequently, management by design requires revision of the dynamics of actors' and stakeholders' participation (ASP). Comparing the differences between the traditional approach to project development (which focuses on the organized project) and the project as an organizing process (which focuses on the organizing project) shows the advantages of design thinking for improving the ASP. This comparison requires the review of common theories, such as the organization as a dynamic process and the notion of project itself. However, despite all the advantages of ASP, this comparison demonstrates that their involvement includes multiple, unstable, evolving and potentially conflicting roles throughout the project process. The introduced notion of the ‘organizing project’ is conceived as a ‘social actions construct’. It allows for a complementary and more global vision of the project. It highlights elements and stakes otherwise hidden in the traditional ‘organized project’ perspective. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Virtual environments of the remote sensing satellites will be the way for people to "visit" the space to study remote sensing satellites' motion and interrelationships. This paper assembles a scalable, immersive virtual environment system called the Virtual Remote Sensing Satellite Simulation System (V-RSS) that allows users to visualize objects and physical phenomena in near-earth space and provides a brief sketch of the design thinking of such system. The software architecture of the V-RSS is designed incorporate the various simulation, analysis and visualization elements of the system into a single, integrated environment. The system employs a VR system with double projector to build immense 3-D environment and applied to some actual space projects and they demonstrate the efficacy of the concept and the processing.},

abstract={A review of the problem-solving literature related to design-thinking processes revealed that the problem-solving framework utilised by novice designers is missing some significant aspects when compared to the design-thinking framework utilised by expert designers. The central theme of this paper focuses on an early phase of the design process, more specifically, problem analysis and thinking tools that assist in problem analysis. Drawing on educational constructivist theory and concept mapping research found within the domain of cognitive psychology, this paper empirically investigates and discusses why non-hierarchical mind mapping tools are useful as design tools when introduced to a group of first year industrial design students. It illustrates how non-hierarchical mind mapping techniques can guide novice designers (students) in adopting the design problem-solving processes/framework of expert designers. Further, the experiments revealed statistically significant correlations and relationships between the analysis phase and the resultant creative output. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Designers and engineers seem finally to be awakening to the challenge that sustainable development has given. Educators and students alike are keenly aware of the need to become more effective in the training and practice of their specific disciplines with respect to sustainability. In the past four years since this research has developed, there has been a marked change in the mass market appeal for sustainable products and services. Implementation of sustainable design practice from both recent graduates and also innovative small and medium enterprises (SMEs) at a local level is slow. One would assume that the consumer drive would push a change in design practice but perhaps the complexities of sustainable design along with the lack of experience in the field are providing barriers to designers and marketers alike. In addition the SME sector alone makes up the bulk of industry within the European Union (EU) varying in some countries from 80-95% of the total numbers of companies (Tukker et al. 2000). These industries by their nature find it difficult to dedicate expertise solely to sustainable development issues. The strategy outlined in this paper intended to introduce concepts of sustainable design thinking and practice to both SMEs and undergraduate students. This current and ongoing research qualitatively assesses appropriate models for educating for sustainable design thinking with SME employees and undergraduate design students. The sample groups include Industrial Design and Product Design undergraduate students in Ireland at the Institute of Technology, Carlow (IT Carlow), The University of Limerick (UL) and a sample of SMEs in the South East of Ireland, with broad national participation from other students of design and professionals from industry. Current levels of understanding of students and SME professionals of key environmental and social issues are measured. Strategies and Mechanisms for improvement of practice in manufacturing and design from a sustainable development perspective are discussed. Examples of the learning and teaching methods considered include: • Studio orientated design project based learning modules with specific sustainability briefs being applied. • Workshop based exercises within the 'Winnovate initiative' (An initiative aimed at improving the New Product Development (NPD) of SMEs in the South East of Ireland and West Wales) (Winnovate 2006). • Joint Day long Seminar formats for students and professionals, mixing professionals and students in both workshop and lecture environments (Reform 2005, 2006, 2007).},

abstract={The new design education for business and engineering management students is a design track within the two-year master's degree MMM program. It is important to train designers and also to teach the people, to get design into effective practice. The programs aim to train businesspeople and engineers to work with designers. The goal is to foster design thinking in the managers and engineers who will work with designers. The Northwestern University design program as a whole is intended to complement existing HCI and design programs and put to greater focus on a business perspective than interdisciplinary programs that grew out of product design. The structure of the program is evolving, but the basic outlines are clear. Students in the MMM design track will take courses along with other MBA students in the three basic components of business. The design track will add new courses on the operations side, taught by both the regular faculty and consulting faculty with experience in design.},

abstract={Design can be regarded as a seeing-moving-seeing process, where designers repeatedly see and generate ideas that are based on what they have done. The crucial point of design thinking is how designers recognize ambiguous shapes from sketches and then transfer them into different shapes. This study attempts to conduct cognitive experiments to elucidate the sketching process and to simulate two types of sketching behavior used by neural network systems. When exhibiting the first type of sketching behavior, designers are able to transform their original sketches to satisfy requirements. Simulating this type of visual cognitive behavior by neural networks could help computers modify shapes to meet design requirements, as human designers do. When demonstrating the second type of sketching behavior, designers are able to see an ambiguous shape as different complete shapes so as to associate divergent design ideas. Another set of neural networks investigated in this study could also associate different shapes by adjusting the TSL and produce different idea sketches from the same shape. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Physiology as a discipline is uniquely positioned to engage undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research in response to the 2006-2011 National Science Foundation Strategic Plan call for innovative transformational research, which emphasizes multidisciplinary projects. To prepare undergraduates for careers that cross disciplinary boundaries, students need to practice interdisciplinary communication in academic programs that connect students in diverse disciplines. This report surveys policy documents relevant to this emphasis on interdisciplinary training and suggests a changing role for physiology courses in bioscience and engineering programs. A role for a physiology course is increasingly recommended for engineering programs, but the study of physiology from an engineering perspective might differ from the study of physiology as a basic science. Indeed, physiology laboratory courses provide an arena where biomedical engineering and bioscience students can apply knowledge from both fields while cooperating in multidisciplinary teams under specified technical constraints. Because different problem-solving approaches are used by students of engineering and bioscience, instructional innovations are needed to break down stereotypes between the disciplines and create an educational environment where interdisciplinary teamwork is used to bridge differences.},

abstract={The first practical yet in-depth exploration of how to reclaim the post-industrial landscape, this volume includes excellent case studies by practitioners and policy makers from around the US, giving first rate practical examples. The book addresses new thinking about landscape, which applies new techniques to the task of transforming outdated and disused post-extraction landscapes through design. In the USA alone, there are nearly 500,000 abandoned mines in need of reclamation and this book provides the first in-depth guidance on this real and pressing issue. Drawing on the work of the well-known Project for Reclamation Excellence at Harvard's Graduate School of Design, this volume outlines the latest design thinking, theory and practice for landscape planners, landscape architects and designers and others interested in maximizing the future potential of reclaimed land. © 2008 Alan Berger for selection and editorial matter; individual chapters, the contributors.

abstract={Designing with a positive lens is inspired by positive psychology, which turns attention away from the treatment of dysfunctions and toward the encouragement of human strengths. I present a positive design method that is inspired by Appreciative Inquiry and draws on a comprehensive theory of design from sculpture. By incorporating a comprehensive theory of sculpture as a guide for designing with a positive lens, we can take advantage of design lessons from the arts, and strengthen the positive design movement in all stages of the design development process. From a theory of sculpture we see that designing includes forming. Forming, in turn, always involves two opposed energies, which can be thought of as a warm and a cold, or an inside and an outside, force. By using a theory of sculpture to guide designing with a positive lens, we reframe our attempts to create new information and organization designs so as to make them achievable even though the positive designer is not an artist. Design thinking and design processes based on a theory of sculpture can ease our dependence on artistic creativity and expand the organizational impact of a positive lens. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Currently professional design thinking is undergoing change, with the life cycle of the product from design to disposability becoming a major concern.

abstract={Beginning with a proposition that architects will require a paradigm shift in design thinking in order to design a more sustainable architecture and urbanism, the need for the paradigm shift is explained by examining what the nature of architectural design really is. Out of this understanding four dilemmas are discerned that demonstrate the need for the paradigm shift. After explaining how digital tools, in particular digital design tools, are different from all other tools in the sense of leveraging the mind, we are in a position to propose the nature of the paradigm shift and how to effect this needed paradigm shift in architecture and urban design.},

abstract={In this paper we track the evolution of computational design from its analog origins to its contemporary digital regime. Our long term goal is to qualify and quantify the implications of digital computation on design thinking and its infl uence on the architectural practice. Meanwhile, we present the results of our past few years of collaborative research in design and computation that illustrate the nature of the intellectual engagement required for appreciating the potential of digital design thinking and making. In a temporal frame, these results are expressed as a constellation of punctuated innovations emerging sporadically during the painstaking process of tackling architectural problems using digital means. In the long run, they hopefullyamount to an approach to fl eshing out a paradigm shift from analog to digital and building a knowledge foundation of architectural methods.},

abstract={This research concerns with the possible support system, which effectively aids to come across creative concept for designers and to make them product. Process of design thinking is, broadly speaking, divided into divergent process and convergent process. In the divergent thinking process, the possibility of getting new ideas is high, but usually the existing concepts block against it. We tried to have theoretical framework for the method to make us free from stereotypes. The author focused into the relationship between 'Utility' which is directly related to the operation that enables the function of design object and 'Configuration' which is related to the space structure of components of design object. Then, we established a method for facilitating divergent thinking by tentatively making a denial expression of the extracted utility. Through the denial expression of the utility, we found it possible to get creative concepts, by widening the scope of images, and to reconstruct the new product concepts. The author also have examined the effectiveness of this theory. Finally, the author developed two different type of products for real market by using this method.},

abstract={In recent years, designers have used digital media at various points of the design process, which helps expand architectural possibilities. Digital media has changed not only the architectural style, but also the design process (Lynn, 1999). In earlier times, some researchers of design thinking have looked at how the role of physical models played in traditional design processes (Millon, 1994). However, the design process has been changed when media designers used to adjust from traditional to digital. Therefore, visual thinking and cognitive behavior of designers also change while using physical models in design processes. From the synthesis of the two aforementioned disciplines, we can find that there exists a point of deficiency. That is the cognitive research about designers who use physical models in digital design processes is absent. This is discussed in the current paper.},

abstract={With an increasing awareness of their organizational surroundings, more and more design students want to learn how to bring their skills into the organization, rather than applying them merely to products for sale. The reasons are many fold and range from personal aspirations to working for the common good. At the same time, more and more organizations are exploring design thinking and design methods as alternative paths to continuous change and lasting profit. This puts the idea of organizational change in the focus of design education. Yet, the relationship between design and change remains largely unexamined. I argue that the study of design and change will benefit both designers and organizations, as it clarifies when, where, how and why change can take place. While design education cannot mitigate a general lack in design research, it can contribute to an increasing understanding of the links between design and change. This will prepare future designers for a role in internal organizational change and strengthen the role of product development within the organization. The purpose of this paper is to lay the grounds for research and teaching on this topic from a design perspective.},

abstract={This paper explores the nature of questions students ask while undertaking engineering design work, how the nature of those questions changes as students' cognition develops, and what the possible relationship is between those changes and the types of curricular experiences students have. Preliminary findings indicate that the question asking behaviour of engineering students do change over time; they are more likely to ask questions that are divergent in nature as they advance in their education. Findings also suggest that a potential mechanism for that change might be engagement in project-based learning experiences.},

Virtual environments of the space will be the way for people to "visit" the space to study their motion and interrelationships. This paper assembles a scalable, immersive virtual environment system called the Virtual Space Environment Simulation System (VSESS) that allows users to visualize objects and physical phenomena in near-earth space and provides a brief sketch of the design thinking of such system. The software architecture of the VSESS is designed incorporate the various simulation, analysis and visualization elements of the system into a single, integrated environment. The system employs a VR system with double projector to build immense 3-D environment and applied to some actual space projects and they demonstrate the efficacy of the concept and the processing. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

Using the tools of design thinking, these creative virtual teams have different management requirements than virtual teams used in the more routine efforts of product development. This chapter uses examples from industry to examine the challenges of managing customer expectations, explore the membership dynamics of virtual teams, and suggest a new framework for assessing the progress of creative virtual teams, concept maturity. An example from the creative virtual team at Synaptics, the Red Dot Award winning Onyx mobile phone concept, is used to delve deeper into these concepts. Finally, trends for the diffusion of creative virtual teams as well as potential challenges in bringing such teams into your organization are investigated. © 2007, IGI Global.},

abstract={This article argues that grammatical thinking within a framework of phenomenological hermeneutics assists designing and may properly be used as a fundamental teaching approach for an interdisciplinary art and design studio. Furthermore, it argues that the theme of grammatical design awareness could be considered as a generic issue across all disciplines in the Arts and Humanities. It calls for a more explicit teaching of grammar, both in terms of understanding and application, and provides a case study to indicate how this might be achieved. It highlights the value of both schematic and formal systems when using notions of rules, grammar and contingency to assist and augment traditional pedagogical approaches used in design education. It recognizes the value of grammatical visual thinking and argues that an interdisciplinary 'grammatical design studio' may provide a valuable foundation for the development of design thinking processes that offer transparency, consistency, creativity and reflectivity.

abstract={How might we engineer narrative strategies within design education to enable future change? Using language effectively, particularly within the contexts of narrative storytelling, is a critical tool to aid design thinking. Narrative theory affects design, architecture, art, management, cognitive psychology, computing, and the games industry, and rarely engineering. Narrative may be dominated by design disciplines valuing the visual data driven output over narrative thinking. Barthes refers to this visual dependency as the tyranny of the visual, and, we could add, the tyranny of data driven design. Narrative thinking may be constrained by academic writing, or confined by technical terminology native to that discipline. Whilst images may pretend to project a reality, Forty reminds us that language is about keeping that reality at bay, or as Saussure describes, in language there is only difference. This paper describes three narrative strategies involving the disciplines of Architecture, English and Interior & Environmental Design in Scotland, USA and Netherlands. The workshops explore narrative making, and the link between image and object; virtual & cultural narratives, simulating client designer relationships, and ekphrastic narratives, exploring the interrelationships between the poetic and the spatial. The authors speculate on the transferable potential to engineering, product and non visual educators, and particularly how narrative strategies could transform disciplines, improve client engagement and impact upon international academic exchange.},

abstract={Fast production of a solution is a necessity in the world of competitive IT consulting business today. In engagements where early user interface design mock-ups are needed to visualize proposed business processes, the need to quickly create UI becomes prominent very early in the process. Our work aims to speed up the UI design process, enabling rapid creation of lowfidelity UI design with traditional user-centered design thinking but different tooling concepts. This paper explains the approach and the rationale behind our model and tools. One key focal point is in leveraging business process models as a starting point of the UI design process. The other focal point is on using a model-driven approach with designer-centered tools to eliminate some design overheads, to help manage a large design space, and to cope with changes in requirements. We used examples from a real business engagement to derive and strengthen this work. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2007.},

abstract={There is a generic innovation process, grounded in models of how people learn, that can be applied across multiple sectors. It can be applied to the design and development of both hardware and software products, to the design of business models and services, to the design of organizations and how they work, and to the design of the buildings and spaces in which work takes place, or within which companies interact with their customers. This article describes such a model of innovation, grounding it in learning models and developing its implications for understanding, implementing, and engaging in the innovation process. The article focuses on the value and functions of multifaceted innovation teams. It notes the difficulties inherent in innovation efforts, shows where some of the pitfalls are for organizations attempting to innovate, and emphasizes the need to be flexible and adaptive in using the innovation process.},

abstract={The architectural design studio is an important process, which aims to shape the architectural sensitivities ofstudents and to develop their communicative abilities as well as their problem-solving skills. Within this context, the intuitive and rational models practiced as a design studio method in the course entitled "Building Design IV" in the Department of Architecture of the Anadolu University (Turkey) have been examined in order to develop design thinking of the students. To strengthen environmental and social relationships, an innovative studio approach called "reality-based architectural design studio" has been developed in this study, included in the program, and put in practice during two consecutive semesters. This research contributes to unravel the reality-based architectural problem and to resolve it in an optimal manner for the creation of a humanistic environment. This experience provides a venue for architect candidates for the simulation of the thinking methods that they will encounter later on in practical architectural projects, and develops their design skills and behaviors. It then refines and suggests strategies that they will need to successfully adapt to their professional life in the future. The goal of this study is to contribute to future studies in the specialization of the critical first stages of the design process through the creation of computer τools." The data thus obtained and the design awareness relayed to future architects will contribute to the long-term planning and research phases in historical and cultural sites, as well as provide local administrative units with knowledge through a process of active contribution and collaboration.

This paper aims to offer a glimpse into early design education in design schools and link them with early design education in the organization. The purpose of the paper is to make basic design thinking and design methods accessible to managers and to show organizations a path along which they can learn about design. Design/methodology approach - The paper uses actual examples from design education and design research to illustrate how people explore design methods and design thinking. Findings - The paper finds that hands-on exercises for managers and their organizations facilitate their own exploration of basic design principles and basic design methods. Practical implications - Systematic inquiry into the organization is an iterative activity. It can be launched in almost any environment with few resources in terms of time and money. Originality/value - The paper shows how managers can prepare their employees and organizations for a strategic design effort. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose - In an environment where the challenge for businesses to stay ahead of the curve calls for new ways of strategizing for future success, design holds some important clues. By broadening the definition of "design" and expanding the application of design methodologies and mindsets to business, enterprises can identify new possibilities for breakthrough multi-dimensional market solutions, step change growth strategies and organizational renewal. The purpose of this paper is to describe how to leverage design thinking into business strategies through a set of principles and practices encapsulated in the "three gears of strategic business design". Design/methodology/ approach - While the methods and economic value of design in terms of objects, services, spaces, experiences and communications is well-supported, the methods for extending "design thinking" to define broader business strategies and build new models is a more recent development. In developing a more concrete development framework and substantiation for this methodology, this paper draws on evidence from two main sources. First, an in-depth review of breakthrough successes has revealed a pattern of thinking and practices that supports the core components of the strategic business design process. Second, experience in working on a variety of projects with clients across a range of industries and sectors, using the complete end-to-end methodology for business design as presented in this paper has helped construct a framework for business teams to apply in getting to bigger breakthroughs faster. Findings - This paper demonstrates how the practice of design in a business strategy context can lead to breakthrough improvements in the delivery of human and economic value, inspire growth strategies and contribute to sustainable competitive advantage for an enterprise. Originality/value - There is a growing acknowledgement of the value of design in business, and a growing interest in the value and application of design principles and practices to business in broader terms. This paper sets out to link the principles and practices of design to strategy development, and provide some concrete methods and examples of how design can be leveraged to shape more powerful strategies and breakthrough business models. This is relevant to leaders across all sectors and in any enterprise or organization seeking new ways to create high-value human-centric solutions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Illuminated signs are not seen as the part of the lit environment and the maximum value of permissible luminescence are used by the advertisers such as street lighting, forecourt lighting or building lighting. The illuminated signs are regarded as a part of obtrusive light problems, sky glow, light into windows etc. are contributed as the major factors, if cross beyond limits.

The Seattle project provides a rich example of how to integrate a broader range of social sustainability into green design thinking. Issues for consideration include: design to encourage social interaction, accessibility, economic development, cultural arts, and improved staff efficiency and ergonomics. This discussion searches for lessons learned that might inspire the emergence of new LEED credits.},

abstract={Teaching civil engineering design through senior projects or capstone design courses, with industry involvement and support, has increased in recent years. The general trend toward increasing the design component in engineering curricula is part of an effort to better prepare graduates for engineering practice. While some design projects are still of the "made up" type carried out by individual students, the vast majority of projects today deal with "real-world problems" and are usually conducted by student teams. The paper begins first by briefly reviewing the design as a "thought" process, focusing on several dimensions of "design thinking" and how "design thinking" skills are acquired. Second, the paper reports on the development, implementation, and subsequent evaluation of a senior design course at an international university, where practitioners have played a major role in planning and teaching the capstone course. The new, restructured design course, co-taught by practitioners from the Region, has met its declared objectives and exposed students to professional practice. This industry-driven experience has also provided information with regard to curricular content and capabilities of departmental graduates. In a way, the capstone experience reported on in this paper, serves as a microcosm of the four year program. Experiences and outputs from the course can be used to provide guidance and insights into curricular changes, teaching methods, and exposure to civil engineering practice in the Region; and helps in establishing enduring connections with the industrial sector. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2007.},

abstract={Bill Buxton and I share a common belief that design leadership together with technical leadership drives innovation. Sketching, prototyping, and design are essential parts of the process we use to create new products. Bill Buxton brings design leadership and creativity to Microsoft. Through his thought-provoking personal examples he is inspiring others to better understand the role of design in their own companies--Bill Gates, Chairman, Microsoft "Informed design is essential." While it might seem that Bill Buxton is exaggerating or kidding with this bold assertion, neither is the case. In an impeccably argued and sumptuously illustrated book, design star Buxton convinces us that design simply must be integrated into the heart of business--Roger Martin, Dean, Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto Design is explained, with the means and manner for successes and failures illuminated by engaging stories, true examples and personal anecdotes. In Sketching User Experiences, Bill Buxton clarifies the processes and skills of design from sketching to experience modeling, in a lively and informative style that is rich with stories and full of his own heart and enthusiasm. At the start we are lost in mountain snows and northern seas, but by the end we are equipped with a deep understanding of the tools of creative design.--Bill Moggridge, Cofounder of IDEO and author of Designing Interactions "Like any secret society, the design community has its strange rituals and initiation procedures. Bill opens up the mysteries of the magical process of design, taking us through a land in which story-telling, orange squeezers, the Wizard of Oz, I-pods, avalanche avoidance, bicycle suspension sketching, and faking it are all points on the design pilgrim''s journey. There are lots of ideas and techniques in this book to feed good design and transform the way we think about creating useful stuff". -Peter Gabriel I love this book. There are very few resources available that see across and through all of the disciplines involved in developing great experiences. This is complex stuff and Buxton''s work is both informed and insightful. He shares the work in an intimate manner that engages the reader and you will find yourself nodding with agreement, and smiling at the poignant relevance of his examples.--Alistair Hamilton, Symbol Technologies, NY Books that have proposed bringing design into HCI are aplenty, though books that propose bringing software in to Design less common. Nevertheless, Bill manages to skilfully steer a course between the excesses of the two approaches and offers something truly in-between. It could be a real boon to the innovation business by bringing the best of both worlds: design and HCI. --Richard Harper, Microsoft Research, Cambridge There is almost a fervor in the way that new products, with their rich and dynamic interfaces, are being released to the public-typically promising to make lives easier, solve the most difficult of problems, and maybe even make the world a better place. The reality is that few survive, much less deliver on their promise. The folly? An absence of design, and an over-reliance on technology alone as the solution. We need design. But design as described here depends on different skillsets-each essential, but on their own, none sufficient. In this rich ecology, designers are faced with new challenges-challenges that build on, rather than replace, existing skills and practice. Sketching User Experiences approaches design and design thinking as something distinct that needs to be better understood-by both designers and the people with whom they need to work- in order to achieve success with new products and systems. So while the focus is on design, the approach is holistic. Hence, the book speaks to designers, usability specialists, the HCI community, product managers, and business executives. There is an emphasis on balancing the back-end concern with usability and engineering excellence (getting the design right) with an up-front investment in sketching and ideation (getting the right design). Overall, the objective is to build the notion of informed design: molding emerging technology into a form that serves our society and reflects its values. Grounded in both practice and scientific research, Bill Buxton''s engaging work aims to spark the imagination while encouraging the use of new techniques, breathing new life into user experience design. Covers sketching and early prototyping design methods suitable for dynamic product capabilities: cell phones that communicate with each other and other embedded systems, "smart" appliances, and things you only imagine in your dreams;. Thorough coverage of the design sketching method which helps easily build experience prototypes-without the effort of engineering prototypes which are difficult to abandon;. Reaches out to a range of designers, including user interface designers, industrial designers, software engineers, usability engineers, product managers, and others;. Full of case studies, examples, exercises, and projects, and access to video clips (www.mkp.com/sketching) that demonstrate the principles and methods. About the Author Trained as a musician, Bill Buxton began using computers over thirty years ago in his art. This early experience, both in the studio an on stage, helped develop a deep appreciation of both the positive and negative aspects of technology and its impact. This increasingly drew him into both design and research, with a very strong emphasis on interaction and the human aspects of technology. He first came to prominence for his work at the University of Toronto on digital musical instruments and the novel interfaces that they employed. This work in the late 70s gained the attention of Xerox PARC, where Buxton participated in pioneering work in collaborative work, interaction techniques and ubiquitous computing. He then went on to become Chief Scientist of SGI and Alias|Wavefront, where he had the opportunity to work with some of the top film makers and industrial designers in the world. He is now a principal researcher at Microsoft Corp., where he splits his time between research and helping make design a fundamental pillar of the corporate culture. * Covers sketching and early prototyping design methods suitable for dynamic product capabilities: cell phones that communicate with each other and other embedded systems, "smart" appliances, and things you only imagine in your dreams; * Thorough coverage of the design sketching method which helps easily build experience prototypes-without the effort of engineering prototypes which are difficult to abandon; * Reaches out to a range of designers, including user interface designers, industrial designers, software engineers, usability engineers, product managers, and others; * Full of case studies, examples, exercises, and projects, and access to video clips that demonstrate the principles and methods. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={This paper describes an inductive study of the structure of relations supporting design thinking. Design thinking is a method used by work teams to innovate by identifying problems, generating solutions, prototyping and testing ideas to meet user needs. Practitioners and academics of design were asked to identify relationships that they believed facilitated design thinking. Respondents identified ten relationships such as relations in which they felt safe failing, receiving evaluation, and receiving resources (such as financial and human). To verify their responses, I collected complete social network data of a design thinking team at a high tech firm in Silicon Valley. The data shows the structure of relations believed to support design thinking work. This study sheds new light on the structure of relationships involved in design thinking work and contributes to the growing academic interest in design.},

Most of time, the researchers identify design problems as design briefs. But recently, some results of protocol analysis have implicated that design problems are not only about the briefs and need not exist at the beginning of design. This paper studied the roles of design problems in design thinking by protocol analysis. The results show that there are two kinds of problems which occur in the design process: one is related to the brief, and the other is about designer's intention. The advanced study has been focused on the differences of the thinking mechanisms of these two kinds of problem.},

abstract={Design education has to take into account the increasing complexity of today's products. Design concepts have to be communicated with the help of functional prototypes which simulate the upcoming product as realistic as possible. Co-operation with associated professions like electronics and computer science is inevitable. The interaction design group at the University of Applied Sciences supervises trans-disciplinary projects for more than 7 years now and gained a lot of experiences and insight. In these projects we always work on balancing the analytical or "vertical thinking" of most sciences with the "design thinking" that is focussed horizontally and cares about synthesizing observations from various fields and therefore is by it's nature trans-disciplinary. The master's programme in interaction design is committed to this challenging kind of collaboration.},

In traditional way, designer is used to describe concept in early phases of design by Single-Perspective viewpoint via sketch in Show-Window design environment. It usually makes blind spot of spatial vision in early phases of design because it can't break the Single-Perspective viewpoint. Therefore we present an interactive media of sketch-based that can get Multi-Perspective viewpoint in early phases of design to support designer. Show-Window designer not only can have synchronic interaction with object of the design environment, and have more design thinking and variability of spatial layout but also can immediate edit, revise the vision and generate an optimum spatial layout again, and reduce time cost of later phases of design by design sketch after via the interactive media.},

The fluorescent lamps of this Activiva Active range, deliver a far broader spectrum of light, and in particular, incorporate far greater levels of shorter wavelength light, in the blue part of the spectrum in comparison of the conventional lights. These new lamps have a much higher color temperature and are rated at 17,000 degrees K. On behalf of Philips, Vielife undertook a research study to quantify the effects of this new lighting technology in a real office environment. The participants exposed to the this new lighting technology showed a 37% improvement in their assessment of their concentration and 19% improvement in how they rated their work performance. Improvements were also observed in the areas of fatigue, memory, task completion, feelings of calmness, energy and vitality.},

abstract={The paper reviews the empirical research on human behaviour in design presented at past ICED and Design conferences. While a quarter of all conference papers dealt with aspects of human behaviour, only 40% of these papers referred to the relevant psychological literature on research methods, cognition, team processes and organizational aspects of product development. The paper discusses if there is a paradigm change towards more empirical research on designing and how design science could benefit from drawing more on existing research on human behaviour to then explain the specifics of designing.},

abstract={Design thinking is a complex process reliant on divergent thought and multisensory, tacit knowledge. Design and creative practice is, therefore, difficult to communicate and to understand. Metaphors play a key role in design, helping designers simultaneously frame problems while exploring possible design solutions and it has been argued that embodied, metaphoric thought even forms the very basis of our conceptual system. The prevalence of inter-sensory (or synaesthetic) metaphors in everyday language, and particularly its prevalence in creative individuals, suggests a link between sensory experience and creative conceptualization. This is reinforced by the apparent existence of different, sensory learning styles that aid communication of knowledge. It is proposed that the use of novel, multimodal metaphors could aid divergent thinking, the communication of creative practice and understanding in engineering design.},

abstract={In a globalised economy competitive advantage will be created through the development of innovative products, services and systems. From a design educational perspective much has been debated on how to direct post-graduate design teaching to create value-add beyond 'Core Industrial Design'. This value-add is to be established through focusing on specialized areas of design, such as strategy, innovation, interaction, transportation, etc. At the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) Department of Product Design, an educational framework for strategic design has been set up, where industrial design master degree students collaborate with companies as frequently and as interactively as possible. The uniqueness of this program was that each student had been allocated a company, instead of a specific design brief. In this context, the problem space and solution had to be formulated by the student him-or herself, using complex analysis and design methods. From an educational perspective, this led to customized course preparation, mentoring and student evaluation. In this paper the following aspects in connection to studio teaching will be discussed: • The introduction of a step-by-step strategic design process to facilitate product planning and management among three types of industrial projects • A teaching methodology to facilitate advanced design thinking and activity among year 4 Industrial Design students • Level of innovation achieved by adopting Buijs' Product Planning and Management strategy.},

abstract={Prototyping is the pivotal activity that structures innovation, collaboration, and creativity in design. Prototypes embody design hypotheses and enable designers to test them. Framing design as a thinking-by-doing activity foregrounds iteration as a central concern. This paper presents d.tools, a toolkit that embodies an iterative-design-centered approach to prototyping information appliances. This work offers contributions in three areas. First, d.tools introduces a statechart-based visual design tool that provides a low threshold for early-stage prototyping, extensible through code for higher-fidelity prototypes. Second, our research introduces three important types of hardware extensibility - at the hardware-to-PC interface, the intra-hardware communication level, and the circuit level. Third, d.tools integrates design, test, and analysis of information appliances. We have evaluated d.tools through three studies: a laboratory study with thirteen participants; rebuilding prototypes of existing and emerging devices; and by observing seven student teams who built prototypes with d.tools.

abstract={Aimed at developing the Internet based industrial design system, the knowledge representation and application in the industrial design process is presented. An experiment designed to capture the 'implicit' knowledge or specific knowledge for the knowledge-based CAD system is carried out, using the protocol analysis and task analysis method. Based on the analysis of experimental results, a product forms design thinking model is formulated, which represents design information process in two ways: bottom-up processing and top-down processing. In view of the particularity of industrial design process, the implementary framework of a knowledge-based CAD system based on Internet is structured; the methods of knowledge framework in design process, main functional modules and application flow of industrial design are developed. User can retrieve knowledge base and database of the system online and finish the concept design in the environment of the Internet.},

abstract={Should an introduction to 3D computer graphics and animation be a part of a general core curriculum requirement for all design majors regardless their concentration, track or degree? At ACM-SIGGRAPH it is taken for granted that a working knowledge of 3D computer graphics is a valuable if not necessary part of a versatile skill set to prepare design graduates for future job opportunities. In an era dominated by dazzling 3D effects in video games, feature films along with the growing use of interactivity and web3D over broadband connections, knowledge of 3D can give a job candidate a competitive edge. With the creation of next-generation Internet2 architectures supporting high-performance networking, there will be a growing need for professionals who think in both "2D" and "3D." There is a similar convergence of skill sets needed for content creation for video iPods and the next generation of mobile devices. Graphic designers will find freelance opportunities as a spillover from these developments. A working knowledge of 3D is an obvious requirement to prepare students for the fields of animation, architecture, product design, industrial design, and package design as well as any design field where 3D plays an important role in the profession. It is less obvious that exposure to 3D is necessary for students pursuing advertising design, communication design, graphic design, book design, typographic design, illustration, information design or scripting/programming for website development. Is a 3D core requirement possibly a waste of time, taking precious credit hours from other courses more relevant to a concentration? What if key decision makers and administrators don't buy into it? What if undergraduate graphic design majors complain that they don't understand why they have to suffer through an introductory course in MAYA? The "waste of time" objection makes three compelling points. First, to achieve a minimum level of competence in 3D requires at least three semesters of introductory, intermediate and advanced level courses. With 3D the learning curve is steep and varies according to the specialty. With complex applications such as MAYA or 3D Studio Max it takes at least two semesters to develop a functional working knowledge of the interface and menu capabilities. To become proficient at modeling, lighting, texturing or animating requires even more time. 3D is time consuming even for the expert, frustrating for the novice, and after a single semester the results can be disappointing. Wouldn't students' time and energy be better spent on a course in their chosen area of expertise? Finally, in most cases, a single semester's exposure does not lead to work suitable for inclusion in a portfolio or demo reel. A digital design major in a college of liberal arts at the University level should have depth and breadth, emphasizing both applied and conceptual skills. Yet a B.A. requiring 35% of course work in the major leaves little room in the curriculum for students to explore other areas. However, a B.F.A. with a higher percentage of required course work is better suited to combining a concentration with required exposure in related areas. Listed below, in no particular order, are some of the arguments pro and con in regard to a 3D core requirement: • A single intro level 3D course does not provide students with marketable skills or portfolio quality work. • Introductory knowledge of 3D is essential preparation for tomorrow's job market. • Exposure to 3D opens doors to both future opportunities in 3D and 2D jobs within the field of 3D. • A intro 3D course expands design thinking. Students are more likely to think "2D" and "3D." 2D designers need to understand 3D as part of the design process. • As part of a liberal arts program, an intro 3D course is the opportunity to broaden horizons, experiment and explore beyond a narrow field of expertise. • Students need to make an informed judgment based on hands-on experience whether or not to pursue further studies in 3D. • 3D requires teamwork and working in teams is intrinsic to design in general. • A required 3D intro course may offset the effects of gender differences, cultural biases, socio-economic disparities that lead to subtle social pressures that steer otherwise qualified students away from studies in 3D. • Not all course work has to be portfolio quality. Certain courses provide opportunities for experimentation and conceptual stepping-stones to more advanced work. • According to the AIGA/NASAD, a liberal arts major leading to a B.A. consisting of 35% course work in design doesn't satisfy entry level job preparation, therefore core requirements should not be "pruned" on the basis that they don't serve the major concentration. • A professional BFA program fulfilling the 65% course work recommended by the AIGA/NASAD is better suited to require a 3D course as part of the general core. With the rapid changes in new technologies, design curriculums at professional schools, colleges and universities must respond to emerging job opportunities in a rapidly changing industry and at the same time be responsive to the demands of a "client driven" educational marketplace. The best argument in favor of requiring an introductory 3D course as part of the core curriculum of a design major can be found in The 2006-07 Career Guide to Industries prepared by Bureau of Labor Statistics: "Demand for these workers [multi-media artists and animators] will increase as consumers continue to demand more realistic video games, movie and television special effects, and 3D animated movies. Additional job openings will arise from an increasing demand for Web site development and for computer graphics adaptation from the growing number of mobile technologies. The best job opportunities in the future will be for those who have good computer skills and can work in multiple mediums.".},

abstract={Our physical bodies play a central role in shaping human experience in the world, understanding of the world, and interactions in the world. This paper draws on theories of embodiment - from psychology, sociology, and philosophy - synthesizing five themes we believe are particularly salient for interaction design: thinking through doing, performance, visibility, risk, and thick practice. We introduce aspects of human embodied engagement in the world with the goal of inspiring new interaction design approaches and evaluations that better integrate the physical and computational worlds.

Modernists are trying to put fashion and brands into a new arena, which gives vintage designs a modern edge. Traditionalists are looking back at old fashion such as traditional crafts and handmade finishes, which are fascinating, fashionable, and simple. The use of colors is also moving in different directions, with stark, sharp, and bold color are set against a backdrop of graphic monotones with black. Complete contrast color continues to move in a tonal direction in either in neutral, organic shades or blues. The casualwear also adopts the fashion ideas of wrapping and cocooning against the winter season in a series of cozy layers in soft knit textures.},

abstract={Research in cognitive psychology and in design thinking has shown that the generation of inner representations in imagery and external representations via sketching are instrumental in design problem solving. In this paper we focus on another facet of visual representation in design: the 'consumption' of external visual representations, regarded as stimuli, when those are present in the designer's work environment. An empirical study revealed that the presence of visual stimuli of different kinds can affect performance, measured in terms of practicality, originality and creativity scores attained by designs developed by subjects under different conditions. The findings suggest that the effect of stimuli is contingent on the type of the design problem that is being solved. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A team lead by General Dynamics Electric Boat will build a series of small and large-scale technology demonstrators to validate the performance predicted for its design to prove the concept. Electric Boat's own external permanent magnet motor (PMM) will inform developments of the ambitious Tango Bravo research programme. Tango Bravo is being run by DARPA, with significant impact from the US Navy, to develop advanced new submarine concepts unlimited by current design thinking. This primarily aims to drive down acquisition and support costs, also hopes to expand mission capabilities. The programme is looking to re-evaluate external weapons and stores stowage- initially based on controlling the Mk 48 ADCAP torpedo from outside the submarine's hull and revisit hull mechanical and electrical infrastructure.},

abstract={Teaching and promoting conceptual thinking in engineering education is challenging. Two recently introduced design thinking models are compared in order to explore the reasons behind this challenge. The comparison results in key distinctions between divergent and convergent thinking, and between concept and knowledge domains. The differentiating principle is shown to be a common principle of the two models, truth-value, or logical status, of the propositions that engineers make. Building on this insight, divergent thinking by inquiry is identified as a mechanism for promoting conceptual thinking, and a specific implementation of engineering portfolios is proposed as a pedagogical tool. © 2006 TEMPUS Publications.},

abstract={The term "design management" is often misunderstood, because its meaning has evolved from the traditional definition of managing a design department or firm. Technically, design management is the identification and allocation of creative assets within an organization to create strategic, sustainable advantage. It aims to add design thinking to every area of the company - from the employees to executives. It also connects designers with one another, links the unified design departments with the non-design divisions of the company to involve designers in every project from the beginning. Design and business must understand each other's language. Working together to meet the growing demands of a modern economy is an opportunity to build a new future for enterprise in the 21st century.},

abstract={New advances in Micro Electro-mechanical Systems (MEMS) deformable mirrors with high actuator count, high precision, and low cost have greatly influenced the design thinking for high resolution instruments on the next generation of large aperture telescopes for ground based astronomy. The use of MEMS as general purpose active optical components will open up a variety of capabilities for both sensing and controlling of astronomical light. In this talk we will describe the current thinking for instrument concepts on the Thirty Meter Telescope project and discuss some of our preliminary results from MEMS and AO system concept testing at the UCO/Lick Laboratory for Adaptive Optics.},

abstract={We describe requirement-driven computational design thinking as an approach to leverage the distinctive characteristics of the digital design process. We primarily focus on information continuity and traceability in the digital medium. Requirement-driven design is an information-based approach facilitating consistent design rationale tracking and evaluation, verification, and validation of design. We present the characteristics of requirement-driven design, which leverage the pervasive nature of digital design thinking. We demonstrate a requirement-design coupling approach, modeling a continuous and interactive design process for integrating problem formulation and form exploration. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={This paper presents an innovative methodology for parametric design called Design Procedures (DP) and shows how it is applied to the columns of the Expiatory Temple of the Sagrada Familia. Design Procedures are actions that generate parametric models where geometrical components are consider as variables. A brief introduction on parametric design is followed by illustrated explanations of the traditional forms of parametric models. Design Procedures is presented as an alternative to overcome the topological and geometrical limitations of traditional parametric models. The DP is able to generate all original designs by Gaudi plus an infinite number of new designs. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper is based on the premises that the purpose of engineering education is to graduate engineers who can design, and that design thinking is complex. The paper begins by briefly reviewing the history and role of design in the engineering curriculum. Several dimensions of design thinking are then detailed, e.plaining why design is hard to learn and harder still to teach, and outlining the research available on how well design thinking skills are learned. The currently most- favored pedagogical model for teaching design, project-based learning (PBL), is explored next, along with available assessment data on its success. Two contexts for PBL are emphasized:first-year cornerstone courses and globally dispersed PBL courses. Finally, the paper lists some of the open research questions that must be answered to identify the best pedagogical practices of improving design learning, after which it closes by making recommendations for research aimed at enhancing design learning.},

abstract={Design thinking has long tried to join form, function, and aesthetic appeal. In cars, furniture, architecture, typography, clothes, or photography, good designs regularly solve problems of movement, massing, and balance in attractive and inspiring ways. The field of organization design is comparatively young in this regard, having mostly focused on questions of efficiency and expediency rather than aesthetics; nevertheless, designers are increasingly being called on to create organizations that "sing" rather than just "work." Here, we consider how aesthetically sophisticated design thinking from the arts might be applied in organizational design. Specifically, we consider the case of Learning Lab Denmark-a research institute that has experimented extensively with aesthetically informed organizational design - in light of the mobile art of Alexander Calder and other constructivist artists who championed flexible design. We conclude that in such organizations, (1) designers must strike an ongoing, interactive balance between centric and acentric design orientations and practices, (2) aesthetic consideration is fundamentally important when it comes to crafting effective design, and (3) designing processes should be given as much attention as design solutions. © 2006 INFORMS.},

abstract={Architects design according to a combination of client needs and their own ideas. This work examines how architects in Taiwan frequently choose to obtain design information from the client or from their own professional field. The statistical structural equation modeling and LISREL techniques are applied to demonstrate how architects select information using memory accessibility and message diagnosis during the early stages of design. Architects were first found to seek architectural information and then to stress the special needs of the client over the standard information available to the architect. This finding helps designers consider how a client's design thinking and how an architect's normal approach to working with a client are used to integrate information into a design.

This consists of a series of creative design techniques wrapped up in a managed project to design an animal. These techniques range from conventional processes such as specification writing and model making through to more off-the-wall techniques such as forced serendipity and genetic breeding processes. Students are also introduced to developmental processes such as structural design and systems design through the project. It is hoped to develop the project into an interactive tool for the development of creativity using the animal design project as an illustrative vehicle for the techniques.},

abstract={The Sophomore Engineering Clinic covers two semesters in an eight-semester design sequence. The course integrates engineering with writing and public speaking. In the past the course has used two semester-long design projects to teach design through a series of problems of increasing complexity. Though the course has been effective at teaching students to prototype devices, it has been less effective at teaching design as evidenced by written project documentation and observation of students' decision making processes. In the fall of 2005 the course was revised to incorporate a convergent-divergent framework to teach design. In addition, the semester-long project in the fall was replaced in favor of one four-week project followed by a ten-week project. The initial four-week project was structured to formalize an approach to making choices using parametric studies in a diverging-converging design process. The design and construction of water-propelled bottle rockets from 2 L soda bottles was chosen as the initial four-week project. Students built and tested rockets which were limited in materials and construction. The limitations allowed the rockets to be characterized by three parameters: the mass of water used, the aspect ratio of fins used, and the mass of Playdoh used in a nose cone. Students generated parametric testing schedules and took data on the performance of their designs with respect to the variables in order to inform design choices. During the course, these steps towards a final design were linked to a diverging-converging framework for design thinking. At the end of the course all students had performed parametric studies of their rockets and rocket performance was improved both over the four weeks and as compared to previous years. In addition, the following ten-week project showed improvements in quantitative metrics of performance over the previous years. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2006.},

abstract={The typical manufacturing technology program focuses on manufacturing processes (metals and plastics) along with computer aided design which is primarily geared to drafting; this is supplemented further by courses in automation and computer integrated manufacturing. As a part of the curriculum, there are courses on mechanics of materials and engineering materials (metals and plastics), and also on electronics and instrumentation. There is some emphasis on design for quality through courses in quality control and design of experiments. The capstone projects do however, focus on various aspects of design, namely design for manufacturability as well as design for assembly. However, the perspectives of design, as such are not uniformly and strictly emphasized in a traditional manufacturing engineering technology curriculum. Furthermore, in the program at the author's institution, there is no course on design of mechanical elements. The objective of this paper is to propose the incorporation of design across the curriculum for a typical manufacturing engineering technology program. It is fairly easy to incorporate design concepts in the mechanics of materials course (typically in the junior or senior year), emphasizing the issues of design for strength. The other courses that the issues of design become significantly important are in the ones involving metals and plastic processing. The aspect of design with uncertainty in material properties as well as other unknown parameters may be satisfactorily incorporated in courses on quality and design of experiments. Finally, the engineering design process and the corresponding problem-solving methodology must be strictly enforced in the senior level capstone experience in a manufacturing engineering technology curriculum. The basic elements of this concept as well as "design thinking" must originate at the cornerstone freshman design course and permeate through the sophomore, junior and senior classes. All these proposed enhancements and modifications to the curriculum are highlighted in this paper. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2006.},

abstract={What are the mental processes of design thinking? How do different designers vary in their ability and skills? How do the powers and limitations of human thinking interact with the nature of design problems to shape the processes of designing? Some people claim design should proceed very analytically and rationally. Others emphasise the intuitive aspects of designing. This depends largely on the design task undertaken and the product that is designed. But it is also a question of how designers think and what they are thinking about. Experts can be more effective because they have different strategies from novices. Understanding how designing works as a human activity can be useful in understanding the causal connections in design processes, and for changing design processes in ways that exploit and enhance designers' abilities and take account of human limitations. There is a large and increasing body of research on how designers think. This chapter does not attempt to survey it. Instead we concentrate on the relationship between design thinking and how designers interact with the representations that they generate in creating and reasoning about designs, such as sketches, diagrams and CAD models. While this is only one facet of the psychological factors that influence design processes, it is directly affected by changes to design processes, and influences the success of those changes. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2005.},

abstract={Computer-aided architectural design (CAAD) systems have been widely adopted in the architectural practice to improve and speed up late design phases. However, CAAD has not been successfully implemented in the early phases of design due to the overly structured nature of interactions with its interface. Current CAAD interfaces leave little room for intended ambiguity crucial to design conception and can cause obstructions to spontaneous creative thought. This research hypothesizes that architects employ tangible interactions to assist design-thinking tasks in early design phases. In doing so, architects can lessen visual overload and exploit underutilized motor skills and hand-eye coordination lacking in most CAAD systems. With this premise, a new CAAD interface is proposed, prototyped, and evaluated to validate the hypothesis. The new interface can retain functionality and accuracy of a CAAD system while also benefiting from ambiguous freehand input directly from users. This can greatly improve the interaction between designers and current computer-aided architectural design systems.},

abstract={Small electronic products for the mass market are increasing in complexity with the incorporation of programmable components. The software in these devices has constraints that are markedly different from software designed for a general-purpose computer. Most computing curricula deal almost exclusively with developing software for that general-purpose class. Real-time and embedded systems have increased in complexity to the point that their development is no longer within the expertise of a single discipline. Developers now must be cognizant of software engineering design methodologies and underlying hardware constraints. RIT is addressing this by developing a three-course sequence of cross-disciplinary real-time and embedded systems courses. We are teaching these courses in a studio-lab environment teaming computer engineering and software engineering students. The courses will introduce students to programming both microcontrollers and more sophisticated targets, use of a commercial real-time operating system and development environment, modeling and performance engineering of these systems, and their interactions with physical systems. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={Piezoelectric transformers were known to power the cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) of the LCD-TV backlight module with high efficiency. Previously, electrode distribution of the input and output electrode of an unipoled disk-type piezoelectric transformer was known to be directly proportion to the voltage step-up ratio. It is detailed that the electrode area ratio also influences the efficiency of piezoelectric transformers as the loading impedance must match the output impedance of the piezoelectric transformer to achieve high efficiency. More specifically, the area ratio was found to be a good design parameter to achieve high operational efficiency. Orthogonally condition among different modes was used to design the surface electrode shape of traditional Rosen type piezoelectric transformers before. Earlier experimental results indicated that this modified type of piezoelectric modal actuator, which was named quasi-modal Rosen type piezoelectric transformer, possessed output waveform with far less high-order harmonics when compared to traditional Rosen type piezoelectric transformers. Furthermore, it had better energy transfer efficiency than the traditional uniformly distributed type piezoelectric transformers. Follow the innovative design thinking mentioned above, this paper used the distribution sensor and actuator concept to design the input and output electrode shape of the unipoled disk-type piezoelectric transformers. With an intention to optimize the input electrode shape, it was designed to match the modal strain field of the piezoelectric structure. In addition, the output static capacitance of the piezoelectric transformer was designed to match the loading impedance as mismatch leads to low energy transfer efficiency. It is to be noted that low efficiency results In rising surface temperature or even thermal breakdown. The design methodology of a disk type piezoelectric transformer, which can achieve high energy transfer efficiency and high step up ratio, was designed to illustrate the above-mentioned purpose. Finite element software ANSYS was used to simulate the vibration of the piezoelectric transformer first. Experimental results were also presented to verify the theoretical predictions as well as to examine the effectiveness of the Innovative design rule proposed. © 2005 IEEE.},

Several heuristics for getting a better look at relevant context issues and communicating these issues to all interested parties are explored. The common factor to these heuristics is visibility. Anything that can be done to make the design thinking and processes more visible will give an improved look at relevant context issues, resulting in more complete design and better fit of form to context.},

abstract={This paper discusses the lessons learnt in Sydney by moving away from a traditional engineering approach and instead adopting an urban design approach to the development of road and related transport infrastructure. It draws on the work done by the Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales, which is the agency responsible for such infrastructure. That agency has undergone a paradigm shift in recent years with some interesting outcomes for the built environment. Following a brief theoretical exposition on the nature of urban design, its importance as a public policy pursuit and its relevance to infrastructure, the paper elucidates the shift in values and project management that has occurred. It then demonstrates how urban design thinking has been applied in practice using three case studies in Sydney that present different types of infrastructure and scales of movement. The Eastern Distributor is a motorway that penetrates the fabric of the inner city, the Liverpool-Parramatta Transitway is a new bus transitway built in Sydney's growing west and the Cahill Expressway project consists of a series of improvements for pedestrians and rail commuters related to the existing viaduct across Circular Quay. Some key conclusions are drawn from these selected case studies and discourse that can be of value to others. © 2005 Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.},

abstract={Through established modern theories of design thinking, the internalization of environmental design through studio education is fundamentally a construct of ego-centrism. This fact subsequently inhibits an intersubjective and discursive professional ethic. Alternatively, a pedagogy set within a construct of practical discourse could ground an ethical construction of practice which more accurately reflects the realities of intersubjectivity found in human learning, in the best possibilities of studio education, and in the discursive processes fundamental to environmental design in society. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={This paper is based on the premises that the purpose of engineering education is to graduate engineers who can design, and that design thinking is complex. The paper begins by briefly reviewing the history and role of design in the engineering curriculum. Several dimensions of design thinking are then detailed, explaining why design is hard to learn and harder still to teach, and outlining the research available on how well design thinking skills are learned. The currently most-favored pedagogical model for teaching design, project-based learning (PBL), is explored next, along with available assessment data on its success. Two contexts for PBL are emphasized: first-year cornerstone courses and globally dispersed PBL courses. Finally, the paper lists some of the open research questions that must be answered to identify the best pedagogical practices of improving design learning, after which it closes by making recommendations for research aimed at enhancing design learning.},

abstract={The present study focuses on the relationship between the acquisition of design knowledge by novice design students and the quality of their designs. Design learning is typically based on action and reflection. Knowledge of solution processes, being part of this reflection, is found to be crucial in monitoring and controlling the design process and in reaching an optimal, creative result. The studies described in this article suggest a close relationship between the amount of process knowledge - knowledge of managing and monitoring the solution finding process - reported by novice designers, and the creativity of the designed product. © Springer 2005.},

abstract={The depletion of natural resources is accelerating. Architecture contributes to this depletion, and must endeavor to reverse the process. It must place emphasis on integrated systems that make the most use of the least components. Architectural education must explore the best ways to develop analytical and synthetic design thinking about buildings and their environments as dynamic interactive systems. Moreover, it must establish a platform for interdisciplinary design collaboration. Memories of toys populate our minds, and they are often used as learning devices. In architecture the metaphor of the building block set is traditionally presented in beginning design studios to introduce concepts of space, form, and structure. It is suggested here transformer toys can be excellent models to explore integrative thinking in design by crossing knowledge domains. Architects conceptualizing adaptive intelligent structures have directly referenced transformer toys in their work. Engineering education already makes use of transformable toys. This paper offers an overview of the history of transformable form in architecture, and design courses and projects, using conceptual models approximating transformer toys as the means to deal with assemblages and dynamic interactive structures. Fritjof Capra's concept of 'systems thinking' is used as the central reference for the discussion.},

abstract={We present the Swisshouse, a novel type of "inhabitable interface" that supports direct and indirect communication and cultural awareness of habitants in different nations. The Swisshouse allows unsophisticated users to collaborate and be aware of each other over distance. By carefully sculpting the space and choreographing interactive elements in the space, the Swisshouse allows users to instantly separate, combine, and customize environments for specific collaborative activities. By providing visual representations of remote users and places, the Swisshouse provides awareness of the culture, presence and identities of virtual participants. And by tagging physical users with RFID tags, the Swisshouse makes participants aware of the social interaction occurring in the physical space. The combination of these primitives provides a single consistent inhabitable interface that integrates architectural and user interface design thinking, hardware and software design. To illustrate the power of this convergent approach, we describe several examples of real-life applications including a remote lecture, a brainstorming session, a business meeting, and an exhibition.},

abstract={Based on a naturalistic study of industrial designers engaged in collocated collaborative design work in a technologically unsophisticated environment, we observed a number of interactions that lead to a number of insights, namely, (1) seating and the shape and orientation of the working surface has an effect on line of sight and eye-contact behaviors, (2) being able to reach objects on the working surface effects an individual collaborator's ability to become the focus of attention, (3) in collaborative work, people may work on the same document or divide labors to work on different documents simultaneously, (4) supporting the use of conventional artifacts that users are familiar with is as important as supporting the use of informational devices, (5) large workspaces with different privacy levels support both the needs of sharing information and the needs of keeping information private, (6) changes of document orientation socially represents a corresponding change of control and privacy level. From these insights and from other sources in the literature, we describe and illustrate a number of concepts for integrated technologies and environments that can support collocated collaborative work specifically in the context of design work. These concepts are intended as an exercise in divergent design thinking that owes to carefully constructed insights based on observations. Copyright 2004 ACM.},

abstract={In designing, there is a complex relationship between requirements and solutions. Creative designing can involve challenging the initial problem requirements; and sometimes the designer's job is to generate product ideas for which there is little evidence of prior requirements. This presentation draws upon a variety of research into the processes of design, with an emphasis on understanding how creative design happens. The research has been based primarily in domains of engineering and product design but covers a wide range of examples, from the exotic (Formula One racing cars and high-speed trains) to the mundane (bicycle luggage carriers and litter bins). The research includes interviews with outstanding designers and laboratory studies of expert designers. The presentation will focus on a number of specific instances of creative thinking in design, as reported or observed, and will include video and other evidence and illustrations. Although the examples are quite disparate in contexts, there appear to be commonalities between them, suggesting patterns of cognitive processes which recur in creative designing. Professor Nigel Cross is a leading international figure in the world of design research. With academic and practical backgrounds in architecture and industrial design, he has conducted research in computer-aided design, design methodology and design education since the nineteen-sixties. His current principal research interest is in design cognition, based on studies of expert and exceptional designers. He has been a member of the academic staff of the UK's pioneering, multi-media Open University since 1970, where he has been responsible for, or instrumental in, a wide range of distance-education courses in design and technology. Recent books by Professor Cross include the third edition of his successful textbook on Engineering Design Methods, and he has been a coeditor of books on Research in Design Thinking, Analysing Design Activity and Expertise in Design. Professor Cross is also Editor-in-Chief of the international journal of Design Studies.},

abstract={The paper presents a descriptive study of design thinking in human factors engineering. The objective of the study is to analyse the role of interpretation in design thinking and the role of design practice in guiding interpretation. The study involved 10 system designers undertaking the allocation of cognitive functions in three production planning and control task scenarios. Allocation decisions were recorded and verbal protocols of the design process were collected to elicit the subjects' thought processes. Verbal protocol analysis showed that subjects carried out the design of cognitive task allocation as a problem of applying a selected automation technology from their initial design deliberations. This design strategy stands in contrast to the predominant view of system design that stipulates that user requirements should be thoroughly analysed prior to making any decisions about technology. Theoretical frameworks from design research and ontological design showed that the system design process may be better understood by recognizing the role of design hypotheses in system design, as well as the diverse interactions between interpretation and practice, means and ends, and design practice and the designer's pre-understanding which shape the design process. Ways to balance the bias exerted on the design process were discussed. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.},

As a result, action researchers nowadays do not see themselves as design professionals. Idealized design methods serve to illustrate how design research can help realize the emancipatory intentions of action researchers. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={In order to simulate creative design thinking of human being and then improve those product design methods commonly used, a model of creative thinking consisting of alternant emanative and converging thinking was put forth, these shortages in Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) were analyzed by the model It was proved that the fundamental reason of these shortages is that they only can simulate a single process in the model of creative thinking. Then a simulation algorithm of directed similarity association is brought forward so as to realize the computation of similarity degree of product demand between components, and simulate the whole model of creative thinking by combining CBR and GA. A corresponding product design system was put forward, and then an experiment was conducted, and the results show that the combined intelligent algorithm has good performance in search.},

abstract={A pedagogical framework for design learning and design teaching termed Think-Maps is introduced, presented and demonstrated. In this framework, domain knowledge becomes explicit as a significant component to be taught and transferred in design education. The Think-Maps framework proposes that by constructing a conceptual map that reflects one's thinking in a domain, we make explicit the knowledge learned. The learner constructs structured representations of concepts and their relationships to other concepts and fills these structures with the content of the specific design domain or design task. This resulting structured representation of knowledge can later be accessed and expanded in additional processes of design thinking. Web-Pad - a computational tool that implements these ideas is presented and illustrated. Web-Pad is used for organizing and representing conceptual maps of a specific domain. The Think-Maps framework and the Web-Pad tool are demonstrated in an educational environment. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Case studies have been used as a means to inspire design activity. Design is about the creation of form that integrates aesthetic intention, functional performance and material durability into a spatial entity. Because the appearance of a building is easier to evaluate than its other intangible qualities, case studies are often simplified into an analysis of form that emphasizes the abstract perfection of an ideal form itself. This makes case studies a systematic way to provide ideal architectural forms to copy rather than inspire original design. A form involves not simply what is done, but also how it is done. If the purpose of case studies is to inspire creation, the conception of form that translates a concept into physical and spatial form, therefore becomes the focus of case study analysis. The paper proposes a case study analytical model. Through analyzing the key words found in a discourse and the corresponding formal expressions in a chosen architect’s works, what we can learn from a case study is the coherence and legitimacy of the relationship between concept and form. © 2004, Architectural Institute of Japan.

abstract={We focused on designer's drawings to determine how designers made images of a design object from given keywords. We thought that difficult keywords would give us good clues to understanding the designers' creative thinking process. An experiment was held to examine designers' creative thinking. The subjects were assigned a task to design 'a chair which gives a sad image'. Subjects' drawings were evaluated and words on sketches were structured into meaning hierarchy. From the results, we found that when the design goal was difficult to convert to the forms, the designer tried decomposing the meaning of the design goal into an adequate level to be able to image forms. Based on this study, we present a model of a thinking path for understanding the creative thinking process of design.},

abstract={In many laboratory studies, design activity has been investigated by observing individual designers or design teams dealing with design tasks. The results are highly valuable for a better understanding of design thinking and acting, and for further development of design theory. However, there is a lack of comparability - and often of validity - of these studies. One reason for this is, in some respect, inadequate attention to the design tasks used in laboratory experiments to be performed by the participants of these experiments. This contribution therefore focuses on the design, analysis and standardization of design tasks for laboratory studies, and proposes a more systematic approach to task design in this area of research. Two task designs are described, which have been applied and verified in an empirical study into individual design heuristics and the applicability of design methodology in early design stages.},

abstract={This paper describes and interprets the use of game-like on-line learning strategies in an introductory course on the theories and histories of 20th Century Architecture and Landscape. Analogies between games and design have been observed by both design theorists and educators (Hubbard, 1980; Woodbury, 2001). The game/design analogy is a particularly useful conceptual framework for design learning, we argue here, because of its robustness as both a theory of design-thinking, and a heuristic representation through which design discourse and practice may be subjected to playful yet critical scrutiny. Game-like learning strategies described in this paper enabled students to develop a critical 'feel for the games' (Bourdieu, 1990) inherent in the form-making and theoretical discourses of recent architectural history. We discuss the game-like dynamics and objectives of two interrelated on-line components of the course's assessment scheme. We make some preliminary observations on student experience with these exercises. We also reflect on relevant sub-issues in the discursive dynamics of on-line design learning, with particular regard to the use of on-line discussion-boards and VRML as a modelling medium portable across the internet that can enable the exploration of spatial and narrative aspects of design discourse in real time.},

abstract={In semiconductor manufacturing, reducing cycle time, producing high quality products, on-time delivery, continual reduction of costs and improving efficiency are the most direct and effective ways to create value for customers. However, the semiconductor manufacturing process is extremely complex. Without good support from fab engineers, creating value for customers is difficult. An Engineering Data Analysis (EDA) system is a very important off-line analysis-oriented system that can be used to support yield analysis and quality improvement for semiconductor fabrication. However, due to the data integration, system design, and requirement for cooperation among domain experts, IT specialists, and statisticians, to develop and deploy an in-house EDA system is difficult. A retrospective study of a semiconductor manufacturing company is presented; the company has more than ten years' experience of developing the in-house EDA system. In particular, the process of developing the system is reviewed, including design thinking and information design. An EDA system that is currently used in an 8-inch fab is introduced. This study identifies several hidden factors that may affect the successful development of an EDA system. Prescriptions for overcoming these difficulties are also given in this study.},

abstract={Beyond the process to allocate resources to a design activity, it's necessary to focus on the collaboration between actors to increase the design teams' efficiency. This paper proposes an analysis of the collaboration which could appear in the design process to create adapted design actor's environment to direct them. The different design models and methods are described to underline the actor's design thinking. The involving collaboration mechanisms between design actors are analyzed then a taxonomy of the collaboration is proposed with three views: the process definition, the relationship freedom between actors and the experiment collaboration in the design team. During the engineering design progress, the project manager should be able to analyze each design situation then to promote collaborative situation apparition by creating adapted design environment. A design environment is characterized by the design situation observed and the expected objectives. The models to describe a situation then an environment are proposed. Finally the project manager actions are described according to the collaboration expectations to satisfy the projects' objectives.},

abstract={The aim of this research is to understand human creativity, in order to contribute to computer support systems for both design and design education. For that purpose, the author has investigated the design thinking process. Creative thinking works as a dynamic process, which can be represented by thinking path models. 'Semantic generation' is an extremely important phase in design, based on the results of observing the behavior of designers. Also, interpretative searching for metaphors or associations with drawings can be effective in integrating the functions and images in a transforming process. The author describes 2 other experiments, building upon previous research into the drawing process of designers. By observing behavior of designers, relationships between the creative thinking and drawing processes were examined and features of designer thinking were characterized. A dynamic cognition process of design thinking could be represented by a model, with multiple paths among phases in a sequence. This model was proposed and tested, then discussed in terms of the clues it offers about design creativity.},

abstract={Some electromechanical devices and systems produced using MEMS fabrication processes are detailed. Two precision measurement metrologies for inspecting electromechanical products are also described. As the trend of electromechanical devices has been towards smaller and smaller sizes possessing robust mechanisms and powerful functions, microelectric-mechanical system (MEMS) devices are becoming more the choice for meeting such requirements. Three MEMS examples are discussed in detail in this paper: CMOS compatible sensors, RF/microwave components, and packaged and integrated passive devices. The design thinking of a new free-fall sensor, which is an accelerometer and possesses a surprisingly low frequency response and broad bandwidth, is mentioned. In addition, an AVID (Advanced Vibrometer/Interferometer Device) system for measuring tiny displacement as well as a Morphinscope system that has the advantage of a confocal microscope combined with a photon tunneling microscope and both developed by NTU's MEMS/NEMS group, are discussed. The excellent sensing ability of the free-fall sensor and the accuracy resolution of the two measurement systems are proved by experimental verification.},

Two initiatives in the UK have sought to improve design quality by bridging the gap between the client and the user on the one hand, and the client and the designer on the other. These initiatives, 'Designing the Customer Experience' and 'Design Quality Indicators' (DQIs), seek to address the divergent goals and impenetrable language that often inhibit communication between client and architect. Designing the Customer Experience aimed at transferring design thinking from the retail sector and led to an Agenda for Change, which included an investigation into how to find a common language between clients and their design consultants. The DQIs build on this agenda and provide a tool for the uninitiated as well as the professional to allow each to express and evaluate the design quality of a building. The extent to which these initiatives have been and potentially can be successful in changing professional relationships with client and user and so improving design quality is assessed.},

The concept of interiorization of the external elements was studied as follows: First, in an approach focused on system, by the mode of metaphorical transference, substantial fluid energy of natural ecology in the exterior is transferred into the interior. The second is an approach focused on program, and it is a mode of analogy in which an event can be made. It can be from an indeterminate program and structure of plate of the interior analogized by various programs and infrastructure of the exterior. The third is an approach focused on image. It introduces the elements of exterior prospect into the interior metaphorically and analogically, and appeals directly to aesthetic feeling through emotional expressions. © 2003, Architectural Institute of Japan.

abstract={A study has been conducted of novice designer responses to problems of intermediate complexity. Responses were collected by means of a detailed questionnaire concerning the use of design thinking tools, the rate of information assimilation, the adequateness of educational preparation, the effectiveness of experience gained, and the areas in which substantial learning outcomes were achieved. Response data was obtained for two different groups of design teams (121 designers in all) working on two distinct projects: a Wind Farm overview design and a large-scale Gearbox design. A comparison is made between responses to these two sample projects, and possible reasons for differences are explored. Contrasts between the approaches taken by novice and expert designers are noted, and implications discussed. Criteria are proposed for assessing the suitability of candidate projects for developing the skills of novice designers in solving moderately complex design problems.},

abstract={In this paper, the essence of design thinking and systems thinking is reviewed, analyzed, and synthesized. Although there are many valuable schools of systems thinking, I focus on both Banathy's and Senge's since there are design spirit embedded in their systems thinking. I attempt to grasp the spirit of Banathy's systems models and the essence of Senge's systems thinking, incorporating them into my design inquiry. I propose adopting an enlightened, transformative design approach in order to enhance the revolution of the public's inner and outer systems through collaborative design engagement. It is expected that by utilizing the transformative design approach, the public or user-designers could gain the necessary skills to envision their own learning, assume responsibility for designing their own learning environments, and systematically reflect upon their habitual thinking and actions. Ultimately, the user-designers would be able to transform their model-driven or theory-driven approaches to systems application into a cultural approach to the cultivation of systems "thinking" and design "thinking". Indeed, design thinking, as well as contemporary systems thinking are two powerful wings to make us fly in the capacious learning world of the 21st century.},

abstract={In this paper, we describe two experiments for examining how designers think with drawings in order to generate visual images of the design object. In the first experiment, we assigned to subjects the task of designing a chair, which evokes a 'sad image'. An assumption of our work, based on previous experiments, is that an abstract keyword is more difficult to apply to a visual image of the design than using a concrete keyword. From the results of this experiment, several different paths in the thinking process were found and we concluded that the creative thinking process needs a high abstract level in transforming a goal description to its corresponding visual image. In the second experiment, the aim was to understand more details of the creative thinking process. We monitored the subjects' drawing process by using video cameras from two different angles. In this experiment, we adopted a method whereby the subjects verbalized about their actions during the design process. Based up the results of this experiment, we found several different search modes in the subjects' thinking processes. Finally, we propose a general thinking path model of creative design.},

abstract={This paper investigates a selection of the points of similarity and contrast between biological evolutionary systems and the development of the car over the last hundred years or so. The suggestion is that publishing of car information, usually but not always in the form of demonstrating that a particular car exists, is what constitutes the equivalent of a gene pool for car designers. Areas of car layout and form are investigated using a set of examples that are analogous to fossils and hence are not intended to be representative. These data support the concept that car designers use car culture to provide significant design thinking, and track the way in which car layout and form have evolved. The suggestion that car evolution commenced with a series of unstable states followed by periods of significant relative stability has been supported, particularly by the layout data and the existence of a particular 'Vintage' car paradigm.},

abstract={Extreme Programming appears to be a solution for discovering and meeting requirements faster (through close customer collaboration) as well as creating quality software. In practice we found XP did deliver high quality software quickly, but the resulting product still failed to delight the customer. Although the finished product should have been an exact fit, the actual end-user still ended up slogging through the system to accomplish necessary day-to-day work. This paper describes using interaction design in an agile development process to resolve this issue. Using interaction design as a day-to-day practice throughout an iterative development process helps our team at Tomax Technologies deliver high quality software, while feeling confident the resulting software will more likely meet end-user expectations. The method of Interaction Design followed here is based on Constantine and Lockwood's Usage- Centered Design. Recommendations are provided on how to practice an agile form of U-CD and how to incorporate bits of Interaction Design thinking into every day development and product planning decisions.},

abstract={According to traditional design theory, the Function-Behavior-Structure design model pays more attention to the function and structure of the product. However this model still cannot strengthen the relationship between product appearance design and human-machine design effectively. This paper adopt converse design thinking and presents a improved design thinking methodology based on Constraint:Function-Behavior-Structure for product appearance design and give a general summarization of the features, methods and technology based on human-machine interaction and interface (HMI&I). At the same time it also combines with the behavior design of product related IT fields and constructs a new outline to improve the design of product appearance supported by the technology of computer aided design (CAD). Thus a new method about design thinking for CAD, a new abstract product design model and the key problem of design thinking based on HMI&I are addressed in this paper. The creative design theory that is driven by HMI&I will help in the development of a CAD software system and in the research of product design and manufacture. Additionally the trend of design thinking based on the technology of HMI&I are also analyzed and discussed at the end of the paper. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={In this paper, the possibilities for implementing modern Internet-based ICT tools for the management of architectural design teams are explored. The theory of Davenport on information ecology, Schön's approach to design thinking and design team behaviour, and decision process management and information technology theories are combined in a proposal for the design of project-based digital design teams. It is argued that the implementation of the so-called Project Web Site (PWS) Technology may lead to significant improvement of architectural design team performance. The structure of the PWS within this specific context is described as well as implications for the working procedures and the management of building design teams. © 2002, MCB UP Limited},

abstract={Sustainable development requires more long-term thinking and planning in society, in the economy and now, increasingly, in business, giving rise to techniques such as strategic planning, scenario-building and foresighting. These processes are usually performed by strategic functions within companies or as part of policy development; however, more recently, other business functions have begun to use such techniques successfully. The design community is now embracing, utilising and creating what might be described as 'design-led' sustainability innovation in a variety of different ways. This paper describes how such processes have developed and been used, with use of three case studies. The first case study describes a concept design collaboration between Electrolux Industrial Design and Cranfield University, providing a number of design solutions based on behaviour and lifestyle within the sustainable kitchen. The second case study looks at a project undertaken by Philips Design, titled LiMe (Living Memory). This explores the way new information and digital technology can help to build community, locality and social cohesion. The third case study analyses a European research project (SusHouse) that utilises design thinking to construct a range of new technology and market scenarios based around sustainable household functions for the year 2050. In presenting the 'real' design-led innovations, the paper describes the core characteristics of these new 'visioning' techniques and how they may help evolve business strategies towards the future goal of sustainable development.},

abstract={A designer-friendly CAD for a schematic design is one of the important topics of CAD studies. There were attractive preceding studies aiming to develop a CAD that intended to enable designers to have flexible design thinking and interactively manipulate representation models. This paper has the same goals of study, but focuses on the needs to support flexible and multi-aspect design thinking. Though designers normally hope to elaborate on their ideas using separate sets of representation models suitable for respective studies, a present CAD that is designed to build a single set 3D model, has limited its ability as a tool for a schematic design. Assuming this as the base concept, authors have studied to develop a prototype of a schematic design system, customizing AutoCAD R14J: Schematic Design System '98 (SDS'98). It has convenient utilities both for building separate sets of representation models and for integrating and reconciling those models to build a single consolidate model. This paper discusses the common procedures of schematic design studies, necessary functional features for SDS, a case study of the system use, and finally, the advantages and the disadvantages of the proposed system. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract={The thinking process of designers is one of the most important issues in design research. This paper intends to enlarge design thinking theory and research by taking a close theoretical and empirical look at the very basic elements of thinking in design. Based on theoretical assumptions, thinking in design is reduced to the four basic cognitive operations of generation, exploration, comparison and selection, which, in various combinations, are applied to the goal space and the solution space of a given problem as well as to the organisation of the collective process of teamwork. These basic cognitive operations can be mapped onto different stages of the design process, thus establishing a generic model of design team activity. The generic model can be used to describe both, activities directed towards the content of a design problem as well as activities towards the organisation of the group process. Three laboratory teams solving a complex design problem extending over six hours have been studied in order to investigate the collective thinking process. Team communication has been recorded and analysed sentence-by-sentence, with each communicative act being classified according to the generic model. Based on previous results in the psychology of human information-processing and decision-making, a two-process-theory of thinking in design teams is proposed capable of explaining the results from the empirical investigation. The implications of the two-process-theory for training and practice of designers are discussed. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Some of the various built-in functions of this microscope, including a confocal microscope, a photon-tunneling microscope, a laser based phase-shifting interferometry microscope, a Linnik interference microscope, and an ellipsometer, etc. are examined. The opportunity to bring traceability to thin-film or nano-materials metrology, which is an issue under extensive investigations now, offered by the multi-functional microscope were also detailed. Design thinking, optical and opto-mechanical configurations adopted, and experimental results of this newly multi-functional microscope were examined. Measurement of a grating surface, the real and the imaginary complex refractive indices, and the corrected surface profile of an inhomogeneous specimen were used to demonstrate the performance and advantages of this type of multi-functional microscope. Potential to achieve and transfer traceability of the primary standard in Morphinscope was also discussed.},

abstract={The 6-D framework is a process by which web-based design and development projects may be envisioned and structured, beginning with a design situation, and ending with an artifact. It was initially created as a result of a Job Task Analysis performed during 1998 in America and Europe by our team. The goal of the job task analysis was to understand exactly how web-based application design and development was being planned, what the inputs and outputs were for each phase of the process, and what the deliverables were for each phase. These meetings included representatives from academia, professional education, and practitioners. Further, it was our long-range goal to provide designers and developers a framework, or container, within which many methodologies and models could be employed. The results were carefully monitored and the result was a process framework agreed upon by all as a best-practices approach to web design and development. By the end of that analysis, we had a very clear understanding of how practitioners and academicians were thinking about and conducting the design and development of web-based applications. From this a process framework was created that included objectives, deliverables, and the roles involved for each phase. This process framework became known as 6-D, standing for the phases of web design and development. They are Discovery, Definition, Design, Development, Delivery, and (post) Delivery. This framework is not offered as a methodology, but as a process container to hold any particular methodology or set of methodologies that an organization has adopted. There are several reasons for its importance and for its existence. Chief among them is the need for rigor and a more robust underlying program of structure and discipline that informs the design and development process. As we move into the 21st century our application needs are more complex than ever. And, that complexity demands a more thorough approach to web-based application development and delivery. Complicating this issue is the shortfall of skilled practitioners in the field. Web-based systems can be seen as representing a class of complex, artificial systems and, theefore, must be seen in context of a system, or, as Benathy suggests, "a configuration of parts connected by a web of relationships." In addition almost any framework that guides the design thinking of complex applications could benefit from a more systemic approach (Christian, 99). This paper will explore how the 6-D framework can form the core of a comprehensive systemic strategy and help provide a supporting structure for more robust design and development while allowing organizations to support whatever methods and models best suit their purpose.

Unfortunately, in many companies, speed is compromised by a conventional approach to new product development. Fitch, pioneers of interdisciplinary design thinking, shows how start-up companies, because of their unique business situation, have hit upon a formula for speed. By studying two separate case studies, Fitch demonstrates how streamlined decision-making and integrated design teams bring every aspect of the brand and product into cohesive, high-performing solutions that stand out in the marketplace.},

abstract={Previous studies indicate that expert scientists use working-forward strategies to solve well-structured scientific problems, while novices use working-backward ones. Although design problems are mostly ill-structured, it was found that designers often decompose an ill-structured design problem into well-structured subproblems. However, little study has focused on the designer's search strategies in dealing with well-structured design subproblems. The research method adopted is protocol analysis. The results suggest that an obvious difference between experts and novices is their problem-decomposing strategies. Experts' explicit problem-decomposing strategies are important factors in design efficiency.},

It contrasts two types of protocols: concurrent protocols and retrospective protocols. The results indicate that concurrent and retrospective protocols both produce very similar outcomes in terms of exploring the process-oriented aspects of designing. As a result, it is argued there is no associated interference with the ongoing design process when using concurrent protocols. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract={There has been an increasing interest in objects within the HCI field particularly with a view to designing tangible interfaces. However, little is known about how people make sense of objects and how objects support thinking. This paper presents a study of groups of engineers using physical objects to prototype designs, and articulates the roles that physical objects play in supporting their design thinking and communications. The study finds that design thinking is heavily dependent upon physical objects, that designers are active and opportunistic in seeking out physical props and that the interpretation and use of an object depends heavily on the activity. The paper discusses the trade-offs that designers make between speed and accuracy of models, and specificity and generality in choice of representations. Implications for design of tangible interfaces are discussed. Copyright ACM 2000.},

abstract={Current guidelines for green buildings are cursory and inadequate for specifying materials and designing ventilation systems to ensure a healthful indoor environment, i.e. a `healthy building,' by design. Public perception, cultural preferences, litigation trends, current codes and regulations, and rapid introduction of new building materials and commercial products, as well as the prevailing design-build practices, pose challenges to systems integration in the design, construction and operation phases of modem buildings. We are on the verge of a paradigm shift in ventilation design thinking. In the past, thermal properties of air within a zone determined heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning specifications. In the future, occupant-specific and highly responsive systems will become the norm. Natural ventilation, displacement ventilation, and microzoning with subfloor plenums, along with the use of point-of-source heat control and point-of-use sensors, will evolve to create a `smart,' responsive ventilation-building dynamic system. Advanced ventilation design tools such as the modeling of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) will be used routinely. CFD will be integrated into air quality and risk assessment models.},

abstract={This research examined design issues of creativity, mental synthesis, and drawing by conducting two experiments. These experiments compared and contrasted 3D designers, 2D designers, and Non-designers. The first experiment investigated if designers were more creative than non-designers when given creative mental synthesis tasks. We found they were. The second experiment investigated the relationship between drawing and creative mental synthesis. We found that how and when drawing is used is important. This has implications for design in that drawing and design representation appear to play a central role in the design thinking process.},

abstract={This paper uses both correlational and experimental methods to explore the power of counterfactual cognitions about the past to constrain judgments about the future as well as policy preferences. Study 1 asked 47 specialists on the Soviet Union to assess both the plausibility of controversial counterfactuals and the probability of controversial conditional forecasts. The results reveal deep ideological schisms, with liberals much more likely than conservatives to believe that Stalinism was not inevitable, that the Cold War could have ended earlier, and that Gorbachev might have succeeded in democratizing the Soviet Union if he had been a better tactician, among others. Reactions to these counterfactuals proved to be highly predictive of positions that experts in early 1992 endorsed concerning the advisability of 'shock therapy', expanding NATO eastward, and economic aid to Russia. Study 2 manipulated the salience and plausibility of counterfactual scenarios concerning (a) why the Cold War ended as it did, and (b) how close the US and USSR came to nuclear war. Changes in the counterfactual scenarios that non-experts endorsed produced significant changes in their policy preferences in the direction suggested by the salient counterfactual. Experts, however, were unswayed, often generating counter-arguments against dissonant counterfactuals. Taken together, the studies show that assumptions about what happened in the missing control conditions of history are highly subjective, largely theory-driven and profoundly consequential.},

This article explores current architectural discourse to understand its relations with the design thinking transmitted through various modes of representations in media, education and practice, and to find out how such discourse might implicitly influence design ideas. The article argues that discourse, in this context, will stand as a product in itself in architectural culture. Moreover, a cross-view of today's architectural discourses will inform us about the present state of architecture, how contemporary architects express themselves or communicate from such points of view, and what might be the emergent issues and possibilities in architecture and design representation. ©NSEAD 2000.},

abstract={Research issues surrounding the development and design of interactive technologies for home are discussed in the Special Issue of Personal Technologies. Liechti and Ichikawa's paper provides an overview of the mainstream literature on computer mediated communications (CMC), literature which derives mainly from the CHI and CSCW communities. It also reports on an instantiation of the kind of multimedia applications that would seem a logical output from that literature. Rose and Kroff offer an analysis of how the logic of the same sort can be applied to hitherto noninteractive technology in home settings, namely music reproduction. Here they show how innovative interfaces can allow much. Hughes and co-researchers consider the problem of how to describe home environments. They worry about how to do service to the richness of domestic life while at the same time providing sufficient abstraction to allow design thinking.},

abstract={We report on the design process of a personal information management system, Raton Laveur, and how it was influenced by an intimate relationship between iterative fieldwork and design thinking. Initially, the system was conceived as a paper-based UI to calendar, contacts, to-dos and notes. As the fieldwork progressed, our understanding of people's practices and the constraints of their office infrastructures radically shifted our design goals away from paper-based interaction to embedded interaction with our system. By this we mean embedding information management functionality in an existing application such as email.},

abstract={The design thinking, implementation, and testing results of a newly developed Doppler interferometer is described. The three built-in measuring modes including (1) single-beam mode for measuring absolute vibration, (2) dual-beam for measuring differential vibration, and (3) distance measuring, are all presented. To facilitate the application of this interferometer for advanced optical storage applications, a circular polarization interferometer configuration was adopted to arrive at a compact size and to enable the adoption of a built-in microscopic imaging system that can be used both as an alignment aid and as a sample imaging system. The configuration of the inherent dynamic system analysis capabilities that can be used to investigate the Bode plot of optical storage systems is also examined in detail. The nanometer resolution and megahertz bandwidth capabilities of this interferometer were verified in various advanced optical storage systems related experiments. ©1999 Publication Board, Japanese Journal of Applied Physics.},

For although sometimes one meets machines or technical devices where not very much thought seems to have been invested, it is normally necessary to think when facing the problem of designing a new machine.

abstract={This paper argues from extensive research findings in design psychology and industrial design processes, as well as our own observations, that interactive generative systems can be powerful tools for human designers. Moreover, interactive generative systems can fit naturally into human design thinking and industrial design practice. This discussion is focused on aesthetic design fields like knitwear and graphic design, but is largely applicable to major branches of engineering. Human designers and generative systems have complementary abilities. Humans are extremely good at perceptual evaluation of designs, according to criteria that are extremely hard to program. As a result, they can provide fitness evaluations for evolutionary generative systems. They can also tailor the biases that generation systems use to reach useful solutions quickly. We discuss an application of these approaches: Kelly's evolutionary systems for color scheme design. Automatic design systems can work interactively with human designers by generating complete designs from partial specifications, that can then be used as starting points for designing by modification. We discuss an application of this approach: Eckert's garment shape design system.},

abstract={This paper reopens the question concerning the contribution of dowel action to the shear capacity of reinforced concrete beams. First, a literature survey on the subject reveals that, despite the implicit belief in much of the current design thinking that dowel action can play a significant role in the mechanism through which shear is carried in a beam, opinion on the matter is divided and often contradictory. Secondly, a programme of beam tests in which the total amount of main steel remains constant but the number of bars (and hence their diameter) is varied is reported, the results showing that the bar diameter has no effect on the load-carrying capacity of the members, suggesting, therefore, that dowel action is unlikely to be a significant factor in the internal load-transfer mechanism leading to final collapse. Finally, these experimental findings are confirmed by an established finite-element package which faithfully reproduced the experimental results, on the basis that the numerical model makes no allowances for the so-called dowel-action effect.},

abstract={This paper presents a hypothesis about design education that is framed within and derived from cognitive theories of learning. The relevance of design thinking and cognitive approaches to the development of pedagogical approaches in design education is presented and discussed. A conceptual model for design education that emphasizes the acquisition of explicit knowledge of design is proposed. The acquisition of knowledge is achieved through the explication of cognitive structures and strategies of design thinking. The explication process is constructed by exploiting a representational formalism, and a computational medium which supports both the learning process as well as the potential re-use of this knowledge. Finally, an argument is presented that the measure of learning, generally equated with the evaluation of the product of designing, can instead be based upon evaluating learning increments of acquired knowledge. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={At the present time, many types of highway bridges are being constructed using various composite materials in different arrangements and configurations. These are classified as demonstration projects to illustrate the potential use of the advanced polymer composites for bridge engineering designs. This paper will discuss the usual design procedures for highway bridges using the conventional materials of steel/reinforced concrete to illustrate the design methodology and responsibilities of the many participants in the total construction process for bridges. Because the engineers who design bridges will be experiencing a change in design thinking a discussion of performance requirements for the total bridge and the need for product standards will be presented. There may be a need for performance requirements as well as prescriptive material standards for future bridge designs using composite materials.},

abstract={The influence of ideas central to contemporary forensic psychiatry on the design of England's regional secure units, as well as some other influences on the final designs, are described. While the design processes were, for the most part, successful, some elements of the design-thinking may have been overwrought, involving some degree of 'magical thinking' in which the symbolization of desired professional outcomes is confused with the direct causation of these outcomes. While this had little effect on the overall efficacy of the designs, it seems to have led to certain security features being inadequately designed.},

abstract={This paper presents the outcomes of a multi-year community design project undertaken by the Temple University School of Architecture, Landscape Architecture and Horticulture in collaboration with a neighbourhood in post-industrial North Philadelphia. The process revealed the environmental design disciplines to be well suited to initiate the important work of community building. It sought to engage the imagination and creative drive of non-academics, and to energize and more deeply inform the forum of professional education. In doing so, the project redefined the academic audience, its locus and pedagogic goals to reach beyond, and more deeply within, the institutional framework. Both process and outcomes have depended critically on the negotiations between the panoptic vision of a designer's map-world and ephemeral, labyrinthine experience of the real lived-world: between domains of the 'tower' and the 'street'. Through this exchange of realities, both worlds were able to inform and participate in an authentic sustainable process of design thinking.},
